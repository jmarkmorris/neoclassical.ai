# Assumption

We can model the universe as a geometry of point potential objects moving in through the 4D geometry of absolute time and 3D Euclidean void of space 

## Goals: 

We need a programming language that enables us to describe point potentials and their assemblies.

*   Make a programming language to describe basic geometry and assemblies of point potential objects.
    *   Ideally it would be an efficient language for ai and translatable for humans
    *   object oriented
*   Integrate visualization at a level of abstraction that can manage our simulations.
    *   Need to understand the lowest level graphics libraries. what is that GL something? Ask Ai.
*   Integrate leverage of GPUs at an optimal level of abstraction.
    *   Cuda?

## Programming Language Ideas

quark(generation, pro/anti, flavor) could then spawn into all the possible ones, which each might have special simulation code.
tron(polarity,generation, pro/anti)
photon()
neutrino(generation, pro/anti)
core(pro/anti)

quark:assembly(flavor,core(generation, pro/anti))
tron:assembly(polarity,core(generation, pro/anti))
photon:assembly(core(tri-binary, pro), core(tri-binary, anti))
neutrino:assembly(neutral, core(geneation, pro/anti))
