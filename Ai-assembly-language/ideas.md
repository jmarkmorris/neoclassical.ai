# Assumption

We can model the universe as a geometry of point potential objects moving in through the 4D geometry of absolute time and 3D Euclidean void of space 

## Goals: 

*   Make a programming language to describe basic geometry and assemblies of point potential objects.
*   Integrate visualization at a level of abstration that can manage our simulations.
*   Where below that level of abstration we can leverage state of the art GPU hardware.
