### Mapping to PPN Constraints

1. **Shapiro Delay**: Must map the GR time-delay (longer path in curved space) to the Architrino time-delay (slower $c_{eff}$ in a dense medium).
2. **Light Bending**: Calculate the refraction of tri-binary signals through the Noether Sea density gradient around the Sun. Target accuracy: $10^{-5}$.
3. **Geodetic Precession**: Derived from the interaction of the assembly's angular momentum with the gradient of the Noether Sea's potential.

### Testing the Euclidean Anchor (Shapiro Delay)

1. **The Test**: Calculate travel time of a signal from Earth to a probe behind the Sun using the Absolute Observer grid.
2. **Architrino Model**: Signal follows a straight Euclidean line. Delay is caused by **increased density of the Noether core sea** near the Sun (Refractive Index change).
3. **Validation**: $\Delta t_{architrino}$ must match $\Delta t_{GR}$ to within $10^{-5}$.
4. **AO Role**: The Absolute Observer provides the "straight line" benchmark against which the "curved path" of GR is compared.

### PPN Parameters and the Euclidean Anchor

#### 1. Parameter $\gamma$ (Space Curvature / Refraction)
* **GR Context:** Measures the amount of space curvature produced by unit rest mass.
* **Architrino Interpretation:** Measures the "Refractive Index" of the Sea of Noether Cores. A massive body increases local assembly density, slowing the effective speed of light $c$ relative to the field speed $c_f$.
* **Observable:** Shapiro delay (Cassini probe data) requires $\gamma = 1 \pm 2.3 \times 10^{-5}$. Our simulation must show that the potential gradient $\nabla\Phi$ in the Noether Sea produces exactly this refractive slowing.

#### 2. Parameter $\beta$ (Non-linearity of Gravity)
* **GR Context:** Measures the non-linearity in the superposition of gravitational fields.
* **Architrino Interpretation:** Relates to the "Self-Hit" contribution of mass-assemblies and the non-linear density response of the Noether Core sea.
* **Observable:** Perihelion precession of Mercury. 

#### 3. Preferred Frame Parameters ($\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3$)
* **Crucial Test:** These must be identically zero in our framework’s effective limit to satisfy LLR (Lunar Laser Ranging) and pulsar timing data.
* **Strategy:** Use the Absolute Observer to quantify any "leakage" of the Euclidean rest frame into the PPN formalism.
