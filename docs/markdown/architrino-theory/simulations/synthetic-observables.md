## Virtual Observer (VO) / Absolute Observer Logging Standard (Tier-agnostic)

### Purpose
Define a canonical Virtual Observer (VO) used across all simulation tiers for logging, diagnostics, and synthetic datasets. VO is not physically realizable; it is a bookkeeping operator acting on the full microstate.

### Definition
A VO is defined by:
- Fixed Euclidean sample points or worldlines P = {x_k} in R^3
- Access to the full state S(t) = {(x_i(t), v_i(t), q_i, ...)} for all architrinos
- Output channels:
  - Local potential Φ(x_k,t)
  - Local gradient ∇Φ(x_k,t) (force proxy)
  - Optional local medium state variables for Noether-core sea (e.g., ρ_core, alignment/orientation metrics)
  - Retarded provenance/event tags: for each received contribution at (x_k,t), record (emitter_id, emission_time t_emit) satisfying |x_k − x_emitter(t_emit)| = c_f (t − t_emit)

### Minimal synthetic products
- Time series: Φ(t), ∇Φ(t) at fixed points (“stationary detectors”)
- Snapshot field maps: Φ(x,t0), ∇Φ(x,t0) over grids at fixed t0
- Provenance tables: (receiver_id, t, emitter_id, t_emit, contribution_strength)
- Propagation diagnostics: arrival-time distributions, dispersion tests, effective c_eff estimates

### Mapping: VO data → Physical observables
Synthetic observables must be generated by post-processing VO logs with a model of a *physical* observer (assembly clock/detector):
1) Extract local medium state along detector worldline X_det(t)
2) Compute proper time τ_det via dτ = F(medium_state, v_det, Φ, ∇Φ, …) dt (from proper-time-derivation.md)
3) Generate detector-like outputs:
   - clock readings τ(t)
   - photon arrival times and frequency shifts
   - inferred “geodesics” (effective paths) from travel-time minimization in variable c_eff/medium

### Validation checks (must pass)
- Causality/provenance: all recorded contributions satisfy t_emit ≤ t and solve |x_k − x_i(t_emit)| = c_f (t − t_emit) within tolerance.
- Cross-integrator invariance: VO logs agree within uncertainty across at least two integrators.
- Convergence: VO observables converge under:
  - Δt refinement
  - history-resolution refinement (emission-time inversion/interpolation)
  - spatial resolution refinement (grid / particle resolution)

### Failure mode
If VO logging shows integrator-dependent provenance (different t_emit solutions or qualitatively different self-hit event counts under refinement), treat results as numerically unreliable in self-hit regimes until resolved.

### Absolute (Virtual) Observer as Standard Probe

1. **Definition**: A Virtual Observer (VO) is a non-physical bookkeeping operator acting on the full microstate $S(t)$.
2. **Synthetic Observables**:
    - **Raw Data**: Time series of $\Phi(x,t)$ at fixed points.
    - **Post-Processing**: To simulate a physical detector, we act on the raw data by integrating the proper time $\tau$ of a "clock assembly" moving through the VO grid.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: This explicitly separates Ontology (simulation state/VO data) from Phenomenology (synthetic detector data).

## Addenda (Sol - supplemental)

### Virtual Sensor & Data Extraction

* **Virtual Sensor:** Implementation of the Absolute Observer. Samples potential/gradient at fixed coordinates.
* **Post-Processing:** Convert Virtual Sensor data (Ground Truth) into Physical Observer data (what a moving clock measures).
* **Provenance:** Track emitter ID and emission time for every potential contribution at a grid point.
