### Cosmology in the Absolute Frame

1. **Two Times**: We analyze dynamics using **Absolute time $t$** (for the Virtual Observer/Simulation) and **Cosmic time $\tau_c$** (effective FRW time for physical observers).
2. **Expansion Ontology**: The universe is a fixed box containing a medium (Noether cores) that is evolving/relaxing. It is not a box that is getting bigger.

### Architrino Cosmology: Overview

In this project, **cosmology** is formulated with two tightly linked but distinct time/space descriptions:

1. **Absolute description (virtual observer)**:
   - Uses the fixed Euclidean coordinates \((x,y,z)\) and absolute time \(t\).
   - Tracks the full microstate: all architrinos, all tri-binary assemblies, the Noether-core sea configuration.
   - Sees:
     - No expansion of the void itself,
     - Only changing patterns and scales in the assembly network (medium + matter).

2. **Effective cosmological description (physical observers)**:
   - Uses emergent comoving coordinates and cosmic time (proper time of a congruence of tri-binary clocks approximately at rest with the medium).
   - Sees:
     - FRW-like expansion with scale factor \(a(t)\),
     - Cosmological redshift,
     - Lightcone structure described by an effective metric \(g^{\text{eff}}_{\mu\nu}\).

The main goals in this directory:

- **expansion-mechanism.md**: Show how tri-binary scaling and Noether-core medium dynamics give rise to an effective FRW expansion history.
- **inflation-model.md**: Connect the self-hit regime (v > c_f) in the early universe to a period of rapid effective expansion.
- **bbn-constraints.md**: Check whether our emergent H(t) during early times yields standard light-element abundances (Y_p ≈ 0.24, D/H ratio).
- **cmb-predictions.md**: Derive qualitative/quantitative predictions for the CMB power spectrum from our microscopic model.
- **structure-formation.md**: Show how inhomogeneities in the Noether-core sea and matter assemblies grow over time in the fixed Euclidean background.

Throughout, we maintain the principle:

> Cosmological observables (H(z), BAO, CMB peaks, lensing) must be reproducible from the absolute-frame dynamics of the architrino + Noether-core system, with GR/ΛCDM appearing as an effective large-scale description.

### Two Time Notions

* **Absolute Time ($t$):** Used by the Virtual Observer. Linear, global.
* **Cosmic Time ($\tau_c$):** Reconstructed from comoving clocks (FRW time).
* **Dynamics:** Expansion is the evolution of the network in $t$.
