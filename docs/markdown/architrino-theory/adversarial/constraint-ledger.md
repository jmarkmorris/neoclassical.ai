### Tier-1 Hard Walls (Falsification Criteria)

1. **Lorentz Invariance Leakage**: If sidereal variation in atomic clocks exceeds $10^{-17}$, the "Absolute Frame" is too visible, and the theory is falsified.
2. **The "Ether Wind" Check**: We must prove that assembly contraction (Lorentz contraction) is a dynamic necessity of the Noether Core sea, or the model is dead on arrival.
3. **Vacuum Drag**: If the interaction with the Noether Sea causes planetary orbits to decay faster than GR's gravitational wave emission limits, the model fails.
4. **GW Speed**: $|v_{GW} - c|/c$ must be $< 10^{-15}$. Gravitational waves are density ripples in the Noether Sea; their speed must match the effective light speed.

### Constraint: Invisibility of the Absolute Frame

1. **Observable**: Lorentz Invariance in local physics.
2. **Mechanism**: Assembly-based clocks must measure proper time $\tau$ (emergent), not absolute time $t$.
3. **Failure Condition**: If the derivation shows a residual term $\delta$ in the contraction formula $L_{moving} = L_{rest} (\gamma^{-1} + \delta)$ where $\delta > 10^{-17}$, the theory is dead.

### Master Experimental Constraint Ledger

#### 1. Lorentz Invariance & Preferred Frame Effects (Tier 1)
* **The Constraint:** Observations (Michelson-Morley, optical resonators) show light speed isotropy to $|\Delta c/c| < 10^{-17}$. Atomic clock sidereal variation is bounded to $< 10^{-16}$.
* **Consolidated Requirement (Red/Sig):** The theory posits an absolute Euclidean frame. We must prove a "Lorentzian Conspiracy" where the dynamics of architrino assemblies (clocks/rulers) contract and slow in the Absolute Frame such that physical observers cannot detect the void's rest frame.
* **Failure Condition:** If any predicted preferred-frame orientation is detectable > $10^{-17}$, the model is falsified.

#### 2. Euclidean vs. Metric Pathing (The Refraction Mapping)
* **The Constraint:** Shapiro Delay and Light Bending must match GR predictions to within PPN bounds ($|\gamma - 1| < 10^{-5}$).
* **Architrino Model:** Signals follow straight Euclidean lines in the Void. The observed "delay" or "curvature" is a refractive index effect caused by the variable density ($\rho_{vac}$) of the Sea of Noether Cores.
* **Validation:** Map $g_{00} \approx 1 + 2\Phi/c^2$ to the refractive slowing of tri-binary signals in the absolute grid.

#### 3. Gravitational Time Dilation
* **The Constraint:** GPS satellite clocks (38 μs/day) and Pound-Rebka redshift must be reproduced.
* **Mechanism:** Mechanical slowing of tri-binary orbital frequencies due to coupling with the local Noether Core sea density.
