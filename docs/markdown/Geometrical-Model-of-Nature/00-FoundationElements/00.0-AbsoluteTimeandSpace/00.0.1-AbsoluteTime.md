# **00.0.1 Absolute Time** 

**Status:** Foundational Postulate (Kinematic Background)

---

## **1. Core Concept**

Absolute time is a **one-dimensional, continuous, oriented parameter** that flows uniformly and independently of space, matter, energy, or any physical processes. It is **non-dynamical** and serves as the universal clock for all phenomena. Time does not curve, dilate, or respond to forces; it is the fixed stage upon which all dynamics unfold, not an actor within them.

---

## **2. Mathematical Description**

### **2.1 The Time Manifold and 1-Form**

Time is modeled as the real number line:
$$
\mathbb{R}
$$

A specific instant is represented by a point $t \in \mathbb{R}$.

We can equivalently encode absolute time as a **1-form**:
$$
\tau = dt
$$
on the manifold $T \cong \mathbb{R}$. This 1-form is closed and exact, and its level sets define surfaces of simultaneity when combined with space in the product manifold $\mathcal{M} = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3$.

We **non-dimensionalize** time by choosing a reference timescale $T_0 > 0$ such that physical time $\hat{t}$ is given by:
$$
\hat{t} = T_0 \, t,
$$
where $t$ is dimensionless.

> **Plain Language:** We pick a standard unit of duration (e.g., "one second" or "one Planck time") and measure all times as pure numbers of that unit, keeping equations dimensionally clean.

---

### **2.2 Duration and Linear Advancement**

Time progresses at a constant, immutable rate. The **duration** (interval) between two instants $t_1$ and $t_2$ is the absolute difference:
$$
\Delta t = |t_2 - t_1|.
$$

The corresponding physical duration is:
$$
\Delta \hat{t} = T_0 \, \Delta t.
$$

This metric is **invariant under time translation**: it is the same for all observers, regardless of their position or state of motion.

> **Plain Language:** The "gap" between any two moments is always given by subtraction; there is no acceleration or deceleration of time itself.

---

### **2.3 Time Orientation and Causal Ordering**

We endow $\mathbb{R}$ with a **global orientation**:
- **Future** corresponds to increasing $t$.
- **Past** corresponds to decreasing $t$.

The set of all instants is **totally ordered**: for any two instants $t_1$ and $t_2$, exactly one of the following holds:
$$
t_1 < t_2, \quad t_1 = t_2, \quad \text{or} \quad t_1 > t_2.
$$

**Causality:** Event A causally precedes event B if and only if $t_A < t_B$. This ordering is absolute and observer-independent.

**Remark on the Thermodynamic Arrow of Time:** Any observed "arrow of time" in thermodynamic, biological, or cosmological systems (e.g., entropy increase, aging, expansion) is an **emergent property** arising from the dynamics of assemblies and fields, not a kinematic postulate. The background time manifold $\mathbb{R}$ is symmetric under time reversal $t \mapsto -t$; the asymmetry emerges at macroscopic scales from initial conditions and dynamics.

---

### **2.4 Absolute and Universal Nature**

The time coordinate $t$ is **absolute and universal**:

- The duration $\Delta t$ between any two events is **the same for all observers**, regardless of their position, velocity, or state of motion.
- **No relativity of simultaneity:** Two events with equal $t$-coordinates are simultaneous for all observers in an objective, frame-independent sense.
- **No time dilation at the kinematic level:** The clock rate is not affected by motion or gravitational fields at the level of the background.

Any observed "slowing of clocks" for moving or bound assemblies is not a change in the background time flow, but a change in how those assemblies' internal dynamics map onto the absolute time parameter.

> **Implication:** In contrast to special relativity, simultaneity is an **objective, frame-independent property** in this model.

---

### **2.5 No Absolute Origin; Completeness**

The choice of $t = 0$ is **arbitrary and purely conventional**, serving only as a reference point (a "clock reset"). The timeline extends infinitely into:
- The **past**: $t \to -\infty$
- The **future**: $t \to +\infty$

As a manifold, $\mathbb{R}$ is:
- **Connected** (no gaps),
- **Complete** (geodesically complete; no edges or boundaries),
- **Without endpoints**.

---

## **3. Symmetries of Absolute Time**

### **3.1 Kinematic Symmetry Group**

The fundamental kinematic symmetry of absolute time is the **additive group**:
$$
(\mathbb{R}, +)
$$
of **time translations**. This acts on time via:
$$
t \mapsto t + t_0, \quad t_0 \in \mathbb{R}.
$$

This symmetry expresses the principle that **the laws of physics are time-translation invariant**: a phenomenon occurring at time $t$ is physically identical to the same phenomenon at time $t + t_0$.

**Connection to Conservation Laws (Noether's Theorem):**
Time-translation invariance is the kinematic basis for the **conservation of energy**.

---

### **3.2 Time Reversal (Kinematic Symmetry)**

At the level of the background structure, time is symmetric under time reversal:
$$
t \mapsto -t.
$$

This is a **mathematical symmetry** of the manifold $\mathbb{R}$. However:
- **Dynamically**, the interaction law and the arrow of entropy may break this symmetry.
- The **causal orientation** (future = increasing $t$) is a chosen convention for modeling, not an intrinsic asymmetry of the time background itself.

---

## **4. Role of Time in Dynamics**

### **4.1 Time as Universal Parameter (No Reparametrization Freedom)**

Time serves as a **universal, non-dynamical parameter** for all worldlines and field evolutions. It is:
- The independent variable in all equations of motion,
- The basis for defining velocities ($d\mathbf{x}/dt$) and accelerations ($d^2\mathbf{x}/dt^2$),
- A passive parameter, not an active participant in forces or curvature.

**Crucial constraint:** There is **no freedom to choose alternative time parameters** along a worldline (no "proper time" at the fundamental level); all worldlines are parametrized directly by the global $t$. This ensures that all dynamical evolution can be tracked consistently against a single, universal clock.

---

### **4.2 Worldlines and Monotonicity**

A **worldline** of an architrino or assembly is a map:
$$
x: I \subset \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^3, \quad t \mapsto x(t),
$$
where $I$ is an interval and $t$ is **strictly increasing** (respecting the time orientation).

**Key property:** Worldlines are **monotone in $t$**—there are no closed timelike curves, no backward time travel, no branching of the timeline. Formally:
$$
\frac{dt}{ds} > 0
$$
for any parametrization $s$ of the worldline.

---

### **4.3 Causality and Retarded Interactions**

**Causal Ordering:** Event A can influence event B **only if** $t_B > t_A$.

**Finite Propagation Speed:** All physical interactions are mediated by fields (potentials) that propagate at a **finite speed** $c_f$ (the "field speed"), defined in the context of the Interaction Law (see Section 1.2 of the dynamics).

**Retarded Potentials:** If a source is located at $(\hat{t}_0, \mathbf{x}_0)$, its influence reaches a receiver at $(\hat{t}, \mathbf{x})$ at the **retarded time**:
$$
\hat{t}_{\text{ret}} = \hat{t}_0 + \frac{\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_0\|}{c_f}.
$$

Only if $\hat{t} \geq \hat{t}_{\text{ret}}$ can the source influence the receiver.

**In particular, the interaction law (defined in the dynamics section) is built entirely from retarded contributions at times $t' < t$; the model contains no advanced or instantaneous interaction terms.** This ensures causality at the fundamental level.

There are **no instantaneous actions-at-a-distance** and **no advanced potentials** (no influences from the future).

---

### **4.4 Path History and Non-Markovian Memory**

A critical feature of the architrino model is that **all interactions are mediated by path history**: the cumulative effect of an architrino's exposure to all past sources.

At time $t$, an architrino at position $\mathbf{x}(t)$ experiences forces from all other architrinos based on the **intersection of its worldline with spherical shells** emitted at all past times $t' < t$. This is naturally encoded in the retarded interaction law and gives rise to **non-Markovian memory effects** (e.g., the self-hit regime, where an architrino interacts with its own past emissions).

Because $t$ is universal and absolute, we can unambiguously define "the past" (all $t' < t$) and integrate over it. This allows for a mechanistic, deterministic model of interaction without invoking quantum indeterminacy or action-at-a-distance.

---

## **5. Geodesics and the Absence of Temporal Dynamics**

In this model, time itself has no internal structure or dynamics. It does not encode forces, curvature, or acceleration of any kind.

- **Geodesics of time** are trivial: they are simply the flow $t \mapsto t$ at constant rate.
- All **forces and accelerations** arise from:
  - **Fields and potentials** acting within the fixed Euclidean space,
  - **Self-interaction** of extended assemblies (e.g., self-hit regime of binaries),

**not** from any curvature or dynamics of the time coordinate itself.

**Comparison to General Relativity:** In GR, time is part of a dynamical spacetime manifold that curves in response to stress-energy. Here, time is **fixed and non-dynamical**; any time-like curvature or dilation observed in experiments must emerge from the dynamics of assemblies and fields acting within this rigid temporal framework.

## **6. Distinction from Relativistic Time**

For clarity and orientation:

| **Feature** | **Absolute Time (This Model)** | **Relativistic Time** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Manifold** | $\mathbb{R}$ (1D, separate from space) | Part of 4D spacetime with Lorentzian metric |
| **Universality** | Global, frame-independent clock | Relative; different observers measure different intervals |
| **Simultaneity** | Absolute and global | Relative (depends on observer's frame) |
| **Duration** | Frame-independent | Frame-dependent (proper time varies with velocity and gravity) |
| **Dilation** | None at kinematic level | Yes; $d\tau = \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \, dt$ |
| **Mixing with Space** | No; time and space strictly separate | Yes; Lorentz boosts mix $t$ and $\mathbf{x}$ |
| **Causal Structure** | Defined by temporal ordering + finite propagation speed $c_f$ | Encoded in the metric via lightcones |
| **Background Dynamics** | Non-dynamical | Dynamical (Einstein's equations) |

---

## **7. Provenance and Identity Through Time**

Architrino provenance is defined by worldline history in the absolute timespace: each architrino carries a unique path history (its label in principle), and that provenance is monotone in $t$ (strictly increasing). 

Symmetries that exchange identical particles in conventional quantum theory are **effective, coarse-grained descriptions** that ignore provenance. At the fundamental level, exchanges that change provenance are physically nontrivial operations.

**Consequence for modeling:** Because provenance is tied to $t$-ordered histories, all bookkeeping and conservation statements must respect those histories. When we construct effective field theories, we will explicitly state when provenance has been coarse-grained away.

---

## **8. Summary of Postulate (Absolute Time)**

> **Postulate 1 (Absolute Time):**  
> Time is an **absolute, universal, one-dimensional continuum** $\mathbb{R}$, with a fixed orientation (future = increasing $t$) and a uniform rate of advancement. Duration between events is **frame-independent**. The time coordinate is **non-dynamical** and does not encode forces or curvature. All dynamics occur via finite-speed field propagation ($c_f$) in absolute time, with all interactions retarded; there is no instantaneous action-at-a-distance. Worldlines are parametrized directly by $t$ with no reparametrization freedom. Any physical "arrow of time" or observed time dilation is an emergent property of assemblies and their dynamics, not a feature of the background $t$ parameter itself.
