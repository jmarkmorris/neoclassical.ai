### Neo-Lorentzian Structure: Ether vs Architrino Substrate

Classical Lorentz ether theory posited:
- A preferred rest frame (ether),
- Lorentz transformations as dynamical effects of motion through ether,
- Length contraction and time dilation as real physical effects,
- Ether undetectable due to exact compensation in rods and clocks.

Einstein's critique (1905):
- Ether is superfluous; no experiment can detect it,
- Lorentz transformations are kinematic (symmetry of spacetime itself),
- No preferred frame; all inertial frames are equivalent.

Architrino position (2025):
- A preferred frame exists (Euclidean void + absolute time); the absolute observer is at rest in this frame.
- Lorentz symmetry is emergent from assembly dynamics.
- Simulations and derivations are performed in the preferred frame.

Key comparison:

| Aspect | Lorentz Ether (1904) | Architrino Framework (2025) |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Medium composition | Unspecified (metaphysical substance) | Sea of coupled Noether cores (tri-binary assemblies) |
| Relation to matter | Separate ether substance | Same entities as matter (architrinos) |
| Detectability | Impossible (compensation exact) | Impossible in $v \leq c_f$ regime; possible in $v > c_f$ regime (self-hit signatures) |
| Ontological status | Auxiliary hypothesis (empirically idle) | Necessary for substrate ontology (architrinos need a "where") |
| Falsifiability | Unfalsifiable (by design) | Falsifiable (predict deviations in extreme regimes: early universe, self-hit) |
| Microphysical detail | Postulated ether | Explicit microphysics (architrinos, interaction laws, assembly rules) |
| Derivation | Ether assumed | Substrate derived as a tri-binary network |
| Simulation frame | Not central | Master equations integrated in the preferred frame |

Philosophical stance:
- Ontological clarity: space and time are real structures (not just relations or conventions).
- Coordinate realism: $(x,y,z,t)$ have physical meaning.
- Computational simplicity: fixed grid for simulations.

Empirical requirement:
Must reproduce all of Einstein's successful predictions while providing additional testable predictions in regimes where GR/SR are untested or fail (e.g., quantum gravity, cosmological tensions).

### Why We Don't See the "Sea" (Aether Wind)

Screening: explain why Michelson-Morley failed if the vacuum is a "sea."

Hypothesis: the "sea" is locally entrained by massive bodies (Earth), or rulers (assemblies) shrink exactly in proportion to the drag (Lorentz's original physical contraction argument).
