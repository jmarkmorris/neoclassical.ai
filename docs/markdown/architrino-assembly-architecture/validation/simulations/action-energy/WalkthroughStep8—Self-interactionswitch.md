# Walkthrough Step 8 — Self-interaction switch

Existing text excerpt:
> ### **Self-Interaction**
> An Architrino can intersect an expanding causal isochron that it emitted itself at an earlier point in its history. Self-interaction can occur when an Architrino’s speed has exceeded field speed ($|\mathbf{v}_a| > v$). In this regime, the particle moves ahead of previously emitted wavefronts, allowing it to interact with its own field. This self-interaction is always repulsive and plays a key role in the stability of emergent structures.

Detailed explanation (conditions and effects):

- Root multiplicity and self-roots:
  - When $|\mathbf{v}_a|>1$ (in $v=1$ units), the worldline can outrun recent wake surfaces, so $\mathcal{C}_a(t)$ includes emission times from the same particle (self-hits).

- Repulsive character:
  - For like-on-like (self) interaction, $\sigma_{q_a q_a}=+1$ ensures the self-contribution points outward along $+\hat{\mathbf{r}}$, opposing further collapse.

- Stabilization and scale selection:
  - In binaries and nested assemblies, delayed attraction competes with self-repulsion. Their balance sets a minimal sustainable radius $d_0$ and a fastest natural frequency $2\pi/t_0$.

Plain language: If you move fast enough, you can run into your own earlier causal isochrons; those hits always push you away and help set the smallest sizes and fastest rhythms of stable structures.
