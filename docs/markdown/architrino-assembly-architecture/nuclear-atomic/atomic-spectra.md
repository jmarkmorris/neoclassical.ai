### Atomic Orbitals as Lattice Resonances

1. **Resonance Model**: Electron orbitals are modeled as resonances or "phonon-like" excitations within the Noether Sea lattice.
2. **Rydberg Constant**: $R_\infty$ is hypothesized to be a function of the Noether Sea density $\rho_{vac}$.
3. **Test**: Changes in vacuum density (strong gravity) should shift atomic spectra (Gravitational Redshift) in a way derivable from lattice stiffness changes.


### Orbitals as Lattice Resonances

* **Rydberg Constant:** Likely a function of the Noether Sea density $\rho_{vac}$.
* **Redshift:** Check if gravitational redshift can be derived as a shift in atomic spectra due to higher vacuum density near massive bodies (Lattice-shift).
