### Superfluid Vacuum Hypothesis

1. **Helium Analogy**: If the vacuum is composed of Helium-like (2 pro + 2 anti) Noether cores, the vacuum itself behaves as a superfluid.
2. **Inertia**: Matter moving through the vacuum experiences zero resistance (superfluidity) until a critical velocity or acceleration is reached (inertia/mass onset).

## Addenda (Alfa - supplemental)

### Superfluid Vacuum

* **Analogy:** The vacuum (composed of He-like coupled binaries) behaves as a superfluid.
* **Inertia:** Matter moves without resistance until a critical velocity (related to $c_f$) or acceleration is applied.
