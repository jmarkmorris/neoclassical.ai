# Inflation Model

This section outlines how early-universe expansion dynamics arise from tri-binary regime transitions and Noether Sea response.

## Tri-Binary Regimes and Planck-Scale Framing

The **inner binary** (maximal curvature, self-hit regime) is a stabilization outcome of wake dynamics. The **middle binary always rides field speed** ($v=c_f$), with **variable radius and frequency**; it acts as the **energy-storage fulcrum** for transfers across the tri-binary.

As conditions approach event-horizon-like compression, the **outer binary frequency increases** and its **velocity approaches field speed**, while the **middle binary** remains at $v=c_f$ as its radius/frequency shift. At the horizon, the **middle and outer binaries reach $v=c_f$ and become coplanar and co-linear with the inner binary**, with **precession ceasing** at alignment.

**Rule of thumb:** "Planck-scale" references in this framework map to the **event-horizon alignment condition** (tri-binary coplanarity/co-linearity at $v=c_f$), unless an explicit derivation links them to another scale.
