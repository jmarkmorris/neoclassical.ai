# The Architrino Path

As a point particle, an Architrino traces a continuous path (or worldline) through timespace, denoted by its position vector $\mathbf{s}_a(t)$. The field described in the Architrino Geometry document is generated continuously from every point along this path.

### **Conservation and Uniqueness**
A fundamental postulate of this model is that Architrinos are eternal: they cannot be created or destroyed. This implies that every Architrino has a complete and infinite history, or provenance. Furthermore, the path of each Architrino is unique.

### **Energy Carriers**
Architrinos are the sole carriers of kinetic and potential energy in this model. All energy is fundamentally tied to the motion and interactions of these point particles.

### **Coincidence of Particles**
As point particles, Architrinos have no physical volume. There is nothing in the model to prevent two or more particles from occupying the same location at the same instant in time. For example, in an otherwise empty timespace, an Electrino and a Positrino released from rest with some initial separation will accelerate towards each other and eventually coincide as they pass.

### **Worldline and Regularity**
The worldline of Architrino $a$ is a map $\mathbf{s}_a: (-\infty, t_{\text{now}}] \to \mathbb{R}^3$, assumed at least absolutely continuous in $t$, so the velocity $\mathbf{v}_a(t) = d\mathbf{s}_a/dt$ exists almost everywhere and is piecewise continuous. The historical path up to $t_{\text{now}}$ is:
$$
\mathcal{P}_a = \{ \mathbf{s}_a(t) \mid t \le t_{\text{now}} \}
$$
Reparametrization by an auxiliary parameter $s$ is permitted provided $t(s)$ is strictly increasing (i.e., $dt/ds > 0$), in which case $\mathbf{v}_a = (d\mathbf{s}_a/ds)/(dt/ds)$.

### **Spatial Arclength (terminology)**
We reserve “length of a path” to mean the spatial arclength over a time interval, defined by
$$
L[\mathbf{s}_a; t_1, t_2] \;=\; \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \big\|\mathbf{v}_a(t)\big\|\, dt,
$$
with durations measured separately as $\Delta t = t_2 - t_1$. We do not define any 4D arc length mixing time and space.

### **Sphere Stream**
As an Architrino moves along its path $\mathcal{P}_a$, it continuously emits expanding spherical shells (wavefronts). The collection of all spheres emitted from its past path, as they exist at a single moment in time, is called the **sphere stream**.

Mathematically, at an observation time $t_{obs}$, the sphere stream is the family of all spheres $S_{t_0}$ emitted at each past moment $t_0 \le t_{obs}$. Each sphere $S_{t_0}$ is centered at the historical position $\mathbf{s}_a(t_0)$ and has a radius $r(t_0) = v\,(t_{obs} - t_0)$.

The sphere stream, denoted $\mathcal{SS}_a(t_{obs})$, is the union of all these spheres:
$$
\mathcal{SS}_a(t_{obs}) = \bigcup_{t_0 \le t_{obs}} \{ \mathbf{s} \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid \|\mathbf{s} - \mathbf{s}_a(t_0)\| = v\,(t_{obs} - t_0) \}
$$
This set represents the complete locus of points in space where the Architrino's field is currently active at time $t_{obs}$. Under mild conditions on the historical worldline (e.g., unbounded excursion over time), the union of expanding wavefronts can densely cover space within bounded regions; in general, the coverage depends on the geometry of $\mathbf{s}_a(t)$.

In plain language: imagine the Architrino dropping tiny “pings” at every moment of its life; each ping becomes a perfectly spherical ripple that expands at speed $v$. The sphere stream at observation time is just the collection of all those ripples at their current sizes.

### **Causal Intersection Times**
For a receiver $a$ at time $t$ and a source particle $j$, define the causal set of emission times
$$
\mathcal{C}_j(t) = \big\{\, t_0 < t \;\big|\; \|\mathbf{s}_a(t) - \mathbf{s}_j(t_0)\| = (t - t_0) \,\big\}.
$$
When $|\mathbf{v}_j(t_0)| < v$ near a solution, $\mathcal{C}_j(t)$ is typically a singleton (“unique causal time”); when $|\mathbf{v}_j|> v$, multiple solutions can occur (multi-hit regime). Self-intersection corresponds to $j=a$ with $t_0<t$.

Plain language: you feel a push now from source $j$ only if one of its earlier spherical wavefronts has had exactly enough time to reach you; the equation says “distance traveled by the sphere equals the time since it was emitted, times $v$.”

### **Conventions at Singular Cases**
- No instantaneous self-force: the $\tau = t - t_0 = 0$ emission does not produce an immediate self-acceleration (we take $H(0)=0$ in the emission formula).
- No $r=0$ causal roots beyond $\tau=0$: because $r = v(t - t_0)$, $r=0$ implies $\tau=0$; the $\tau=0$ case is excluded by $H(0)=0$. Under mollification, the symmetric limit as $r\to 0$ yields zero net push.

Sphere streams from different Architrinos pass through each other without interacting. This non-interference is what allows for the principle of superposition to be applied when calculating the total acceleration on a particle. In practice, every Architrino is always “riding” the superposed sphere streams of all other Architrinos—and, when kinematics permit (whenever $|\mathbf{v}|>v$ at some emission times), of its own past emissions. The complexity is manageable by treating each causal intersection separately and weighting by distance: each hit contributes a purely radial push scaled by $1/r^2$ (with emitter-side speed modulations), so nearby sources dominate while far ones fade.

### **The Stationary Architrino and Absolute Space**
A special and fundamental case arises when an Architrino is stationary with respect to absolute space, i.e., its velocity $\mathbf{v}_a = 0$.

-   **Static Sphere Stream Geometry:** For a stationary Architrino at a fixed position $\mathbf{s}_{fixed}$, its sphere stream consists of a continuous family of perfectly concentric spherical shells. While each individual shell expands, the overall geometric form of the stream is static and time-invariant.

-   **Bridge to Absolute Space:** This state is physically distinguishable from any state of non-zero velocity. An Architrino in motion ($\mathbf{v}_a \neq 0$) generates a non-concentric sphere stream whose pattern is dynamic. The perfect symmetry of the stationary stream provides a unique, observable reference frame. Therefore, the state of being at rest in absolute space is not relative but absolute, providing a direct mathematical and physical bridge to the underlying structure of absolute space.

### **Future Path and Superposition**
The future path (for $t > t_{\text{now}}$) is determined by integrating the equation of motion, using the Architrino's current position $\mathbf{s}_a(t_{\text{now}})$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}_a(t_{\text{now}})$ as initial conditions.

The total acceleration on an Architrino at any instant is the vector sum of the individual accelerations caused by each intersecting potential sphere from all other source particles. This is the **principle of superposition**:
$$
\mathbf{a}_{a, \text{total}}(t) = \sum_{j} \mathbf{a}_{a,j}(t)
$$
where $\mathbf{a}_{a,j}(t)$ is the acceleration induced on the Architrino by the field of source particle $j$. An individual acceleration term is non-zero only if the interaction condition with particle $j$ is met at time $t$.

The specific interaction rules that determine the acceleration are defined for subtypes of Architrinos, such as the Electrino and Positrino.
