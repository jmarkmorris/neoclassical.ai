The Electrino is a fundamental particle modeled as an Architrino with a negative elementary charge.

### **1. Geometric and Field Properties**

-   **Type:** The Electrino is an instance of the Architrino geometry.
-   **Charge:** It carries a negative charge, $q = -\epsilon$.
-   **Emission:** It generates a field identical to the Architrino's, where the magnitude $q$ is set to $-\epsilon$. This field propagates outward as an expanding spherical shell of negative potential, with a surface density that decreases as $1/r^2$.

### **2. Interaction Dynamics (Equation of Motion)**

An Electrino, located at position $\mathbf{s}_e(t)$, is a point particle that moves in response to the potential fields generated by other source particles (Electrinos or Positrinos). In this flat, non-dynamical background, free motion is straight-line and constant-velocity; any deviation is due to fields and assemblies, not background curvature.

-   **Causal Interaction:** Use the canonical Master Equation of Motion. We work in units with field speed $v=1$. For the Electrino with $q_e=-\epsilon$, each causal contribution from a source $j$ is purely radial along $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{je}$, with like charges repelling and unlike charges attracting. The per-hit strength scales as $1/r^2$ with sign set by $\sigma_{q_j q_e}$. The net acceleration sums over all $t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_j(t)$ and over all sources $j$.

    Plain language: every earlier sphere that can arrive now pushes along the line back to its emission point (the receiver can only infer the unoriented line; orientation along that line is ambiguous at a single hit); closer hits push harder. Emission cadence and per-wavefront amplitude are constant. The receiverâ€™s velocity affects only the instantaneous power via $\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v} = |\mathbf{F}|\,v_r$.

This behavior is consistent with a force law where like charges repel and opposite charges attract.

### **3. Path**

The Electrino follows the general path dynamics described in the main Architrino Path document. Its path is the set of historical positions:
$$
\mathcal{P}_e = \{ \mathbf{s}_e(t) \mid t \le t_{\text{now}} \}
$$
Its future trajectory is determined by its current state $(\mathbf{s}_e, \mathbf{v}_e)$ and the superposition of accelerations from all intersecting fields.
