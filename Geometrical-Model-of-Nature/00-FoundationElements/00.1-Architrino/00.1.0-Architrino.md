### Core Emission Properties

An Architrino is a transceiver: it continuously emits potential wavefronts and also receives and responds to incoming wavefronts from other sources. The fundamental transmit operation of an Architrino is the continuous emission of a potential field. This process has the following key properties:

-   **Constant rate of shell emission:** Each Architrino emits expanding spherical shells (wavefronts) at a constant rate and constant per-shell amplitude (independent of speed).
-   **Point of Emission:** The potential emerges at the Architrino's current location (radius = 0) at time $t=\text{now}$ as a spatial Dirac delta.
-   **Spherical Expansion:** From its point of emission, the potential expands as a perfectly spherical shell.
-   **Field Speed:** The radius of this shell grows at a constant rate, the field speed $v$.
-   **Surface Density:** The magnitude of the potential is concentrated on the surface of the shell and decreases as a function of $1/r^2$, where $r$ is the shell's radius.

We work in units with field speed $v=1$.

### Geometric characterization

Consider timespace $M=\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^3$ with coordinates $(t,\mathbf{s})$ and Euclidean spatial metric. An emission event at $(t_0,\mathbf{s}_0)$ generates a radially symmetric, measure-valued field supported on the expanding spherical shell (wavefront)
$$
\mathcal{C}=\{(t,\mathbf{s}) : t\ge t_0,\; r = v\,(t-t_0)\},\quad r=\|\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0\|,
$$
where $v$ is the constant field speed. At the emission time $t=t_0$, the field is a spatial Dirac delta of charge $q$ located at $\mathbf{s}_0$. The magnitude of this fundamental charge is defined as $|q| = |e/6|$, where $e$ is the elementary charge of an electron. At each fixed time $t>t_0$, the field is a surface delta measure on the sphere $S_{r}$ of radius $r=v(t-t_0)$ centered at $\mathbf{s}_0$, normalized so its total mass is $q$.

This expanding wavefront has two key properties:
-   **Indefinite Expansion:** The shell expands indefinitely as $t \to \infty$. The radius $r = v(t-t_0)$ grows without bound, and the surface density $q/(4\pi r^2)$ approaches zero but never reaches it.
-   **Non-interaction with Particles:** The field passes through other Architrinos without being altered, absorbed, or scattered. Its sole effect is to impart an acceleration on the particles it intersects.

### Analytic form

Let $\tau=t-t_0$ and $r=\|\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0\|$. The measure-valued density (per unit volume) is
$$
\rho(t,\mathbf{s})
=\frac{q}{4\pi r^2}\,\delta\!\big(r - v\,\tau\big)\,H(\tau),
$$
where $H$ is the Heaviside step function. Equivalently, using the surface delta $\delta_{S_r}$ (a distribution supported on the sphere $S_r$ with $\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\delta_{S_r}\,\mathrm{d}^3s=4\pi r^2$),
$$
\rho(t,\mathbf{s})=\frac{q}{4\pi r^2}\,\delta_{S_{v\tau}}(\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0)\,H(\tau).
$$
- **Support:** $r=v\tau$ and $\tau\ge 0$.
- **Conservation:** $\displaystyle \int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\rho(t,\mathbf{s})\,\mathrm{d}^3s = q$ for all $t>t_0$.
- **Pointwise scaling on the sphere:** the surface density scales as $q/(4\pi r^2)$, giving the stated $1/r^2$ falloff on the expanding sphere.

Normalization and Jacobians:
- Radial source representation in spherical coordinates: $q\,\delta(t-t_0)\,\dfrac{\delta(r)}{4\pi r^2}$.
- Delta change-of-variables identity: $\delta(r - v\,\tau) = \dfrac{1}{v}\,\delta\!\big(\tau - r/v\big)$; the $1/v$ factor appears only when integrating over time at fixed $r$.
- Normalization check: $\displaystyle \int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\rho(t,\mathbf{s})\,d^3s = q$ for all $t>t_0$ since $\int \dfrac{q}{4\pi r^2}\,\delta(r-v\tau)\,4\pi r^2\,dr = q$.

Plain language: the bigger the shell gets, the thinner the “potential paint” on it becomes—spread over a larger area—in just the right way to keep the total amount constant.

### Governing conservation law

This field is the delayed, spherically symmetric, measure-valued solution of the radial continuity equation with a point-source impulse:
$$
\partial_t \rho + \nabla\cdot\big(v\,\hat{\mathbf{r}}\,\rho\big) = q\,\delta(t-t_0)\,\delta^{(3)}(\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0),
\quad \hat{\mathbf{r}}=\frac{\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0}{\|\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0\|}.
$$
Equivalently, in radial form,
$$
\partial_t \rho + v\,\partial_r \rho + \frac{2v}{r}\,\rho = q\,\delta(t-t_0)\,\frac{\delta(r)}{4\pi r^2},
$$
whose delayed solution is $\rho(t,\mathbf{s})=\dfrac{q}{4\pi r^2}\delta(r-v\tau)H(\tau)$.

Plain language: the conservation law says nothing is lost or gained as the ripple expands; what flows through each spherical shell in time is exactly what was injected at the center.

Geodesics and dynamics: The background is flat and non-dynamical; free motion follows straight lines at constant velocity. All accelerations in this model come from interactions with fields and assemblies on this fixed background, not from curvature of the background itself.

### Advanced Dynamics: Velocity Regimes and Emission

This section details more advanced concepts regarding the Architrino's motion and its field generation.

There is no kinematic cap on $|\mathbf{v}_a|$; emergent assemblies impose operational limits.

#### **Velocity Regimes and Local Field Interaction**
The model places no inherent limit on the speed of an Architrino, $|\mathbf{v}_a|$. Its velocity relative to the field speed $v$ defines three distinct dynamic regimes. Consider a particle at position $\mathbf{s}_a(t_{\text{now}})$ moving with velocity $\mathbf{v}_a$. At an infinitesimal time $\Delta t$ later, its new position is $\mathbf{s}_a(t_{\text{now}} + \Delta t)$. The spherical shell it emitted at $t_{\text{now}}$ has expanded to a radius of $r = v \Delta t$.

-   **Sub-field Speed ($|\mathbf{v}_a| < v$):** The particle travels a distance less than the shell's radius. It is located *inside* the sphere of its most recent emission, lagging behind it.
-   **Super-field Speed ($|\mathbf{v}_a| > v$):** The particle travels a distance greater than the shell's radius. It is located *outside* the sphere of its most recent emission, moving ahead of it.
-   **Symmetry Point ($|\mathbf{v}_a| = v$):** The particle travels exactly on the edge of its own expanding spherical shell. This represents a critical symmetry-breaking point in its dynamics.

It is important to distinguish this immediate relationship (between $t_{\text{now}}$ and $t_{\text{now}} + \Delta t$) from the possibility of an Architrino intersecting one of its own spherical shells emitted earlier in its path history. This is somewhat analogous to a speedboat passing its own wake, and later curving or stopping such that its past wake catches up and passes. These regimes control the structure and multiplicity of causal intersection times $\mathcal{C}_a(t)$ along worldlines (see Action and Interaction).
