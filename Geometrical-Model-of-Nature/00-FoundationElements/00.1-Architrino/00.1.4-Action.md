# Action and Interaction

The dynamics of an Architrino are governed by a simple action: an acceleration caused by the intersection of its path with a potential field.
For detailed derivations and worked explanations, see 00.2.1 — Exposition (walkthroughs index).

Geodesics and dynamics: The background is fixed (absolute time × Euclidean space); free paths are straight. Accelerations come only from delayed, purely radial hits from emitted shells—never from background curvature.

### **Units and constants**
-   We choose units with field speed $v=1$ (select $L_0,T_0$ so $v=L_0/T_0=1$); all speeds are hence dimensionless.
-   $\kappa>0$ is the universal coupling constant controlling interaction strength.
-   $\eta>0$ is the default shell thickness for regularization.

Symbols:
-   $v=1$ (field speed by units), $\kappa>0$ (coupling), $\eta>0$ (shell thickness)
-   $\epsilon>0$ (unit charge magnitude); Electrino $q=-\epsilon$, Positrino $q=+\epsilon$
-   $\sigma_{q q'}=\mathrm{sign}(q\,q')\in\{+1,-1\}$
-   $r=\|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)-\mathbf{s}_o(t_0)\|$, $\;\hat{\mathbf{r}}=(\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)-\mathbf{s}_o(t_0))/r$

### **Fundamental Interaction**

Action occurs when a point object $o'$ at position $\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)$ intersects the potential field $\Phi_o$ generated by a source object $o$ at an earlier emission time $t_0$. This delayed interaction is the sole mechanism of force in the model.

-   **Causal Interaction Set:** The receiver $o'$ at time $t$ interacts with a source $o$ through the (possibly multi-valued) set of causal emission times
    $$
    \mathcal{C}_o(t) = \big\{\, t_0 < t \;\big|\; \|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t_0)\| = (t - t_0) \,\big\}.
    \quad\text{(CT)}
    $$
    For $|\mathbf{v}_o(t_0)| < 1$ locally, $\mathcal{C}_o(t)$ is generically a singleton; for $|\mathbf{v}_o|> 1$ it may contain multiple solutions (including self-hits when $o'=o$). In plain language: this set collects all earlier moments of the source that can send a sphere to arrive exactly “now” at the receiver’s current location.

-   **Master Equation of Motion (canonical):** For each $t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_o(t)$, define
    $$
    \hat{\mathbf{r}} = \frac{\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t_0)}{\|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t_0)\|}, \quad r = \|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t_0)\|.
    $$
    The signed, purely radial contribution is
    $$
    \mathbf{a}_{o'\leftarrow o}(t; t_0) = \kappa\,\sigma_{q_o q_{o'}}\,\frac{|q_o q_{o'}|}{r^2}\,\hat{\mathbf{r}}.
    \quad\text{(EOM)}
    $$
    No magnetic/right-hand-rule terms appear; there are no cross products or velocity-direction couplings—only radial action along $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$. The total acceleration superposes over all sources and causal times:
    $$
    \mathbf{a}_{o'}(t) = \sum_{o}\ \sum_{t_0\in \mathcal{C}_o(t)} \mathbf{a}_{o'\leftarrow o}(t; t_0).
    $$

    Conventions and exclusions:
    - Geometric normalization factors (e.g., $1/(4\pi)$ and any $1/v$ from $\delta$ change-of-variables) are absorbed into $\kappa$; the canonical per-hit law is written with $\kappa\,|q_o q_{o'}|/r^2$.
    - Heaviside convention $H(0)=0$ (no instantaneous self-force).
    - No $r=0$ causal roots beyond $\tau=0$: because $r = v(t - t_0)$, $r=0$ implies $\tau=0$; the $\tau=0$ case is excluded by $H(0)=0$. Under mollification, the symmetric limit as $r\to 0$ yields zero net push.
    - Regularization uses the shell $\delta(r-\tau)\to\delta_\eta(r-\tau)$ when continuous-time dynamics are needed.

    Two-body checks (stationary sources):
    - Like charges ($\sigma=+1$): repulsion along $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$.
    - Unlike charges ($\sigma=-1$): attraction along $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$.
    - Stationary source: symmetry implies purely radial action; no tangential component.

    In plain language: for each qualifying earlier emission, draw the line from where it was emitted to where the receiver is now, push along that line with a strength set by the charges and a $1/r^2$ falloff, then add up all such pushes.

### Receiver velocity: radial vs orthogonal components (instantaneous effect)

At a given hit $(t;t_0)$, decompose the receiver velocity into components parallel and orthogonal to the line of action $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$:
$$
\mathbf{v}_{o'}(t) \;=\; v_r\,\hat{\mathbf{r}} \;+\; \mathbf{v}_\perp,
\qquad v_r \equiv \mathbf{v}_{o'}(t)\cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}},
\qquad \mathbf{v}_\perp \equiv \mathbf{v}_{o'}(t) - v_r \hat{\mathbf{r}}.
$$
Because $\mathbf{a}_{o'\leftarrow o}(t;t_0) \parallel \hat{\mathbf{r}}$, its instantaneous effect satisfies
$$
\frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{v}_\perp \;=\; \mathbf{0}\quad\text{from this hit}, 
\qquad
\frac{d}{dt}v_r \;=\; \mathbf{a}_{o'\leftarrow o}(t;t_0)\cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}}
\;=\;
\frac{\kappa\,\sigma_{q_o q_{o'}}\,|q_o q_{o'}|}{r^2}.
$$
Thus the per-hit work rate is $\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{v} = (\mathbf{a}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{r}})\,v_r$; there is no instantaneous work on the orthogonal component.

Radial motion and the $1/r^2$ factor (local trend):
- Inward motion ($v_r<0$, receiver moving toward the source history point) decreases $r$ between close successive hits, tending to increase subsequent per-hit strengths via $1/r^2$ (all else equal).
- Outward motion ($v_r>0$) increases $r$, tending to decrease subsequent per-hit strengths.

Path-history delay shifts both the causal root $t_0$ and $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ over finite intervals, so these are local statements.

Modeling note: Emission cadence and per-wavefront amplitude are constant. The receiver’s velocity does not further modulate the force magnitude; it influences the instantaneous power through $\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{v} = |\mathbf{a}|\,v_r$ and the subsequent evolution of $r$.

Plain language: split your velocity into along-the-line and sideways. A hit only changes the along-the-line piece right now; sideways motion continues. If you’re moving inward, the next pushes tend to be stronger (1/r²); outward, weaker.

### **Well-posedness and Regularization**
The surface–delta shells yield impulsive forces at isolated hit times. One may treat the dynamics as a measure-driven ODE in $t$ (with velocity of bounded variation), or regularize by replacing the surface delta with a narrow shell of thickness $\eta$,
$$
\delta(r - \tau)\ \longrightarrow\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\,\eta}\,\exp\!\Big(-\frac{(r - \tau)^2}{2\eta^2}\Big),\quad\text{(REG)}
$$
while preserving total emission $q$. This produces continuous-in-time forces and classical $C^1$ solutions for $\mathbf{s}(t)$ given $C^1$ initial data. In the super-field-speed regime ($|\mathbf{v}_a|>1$), multiple self-roots can occur; summing over all causal times with an integrable regularization ensures finite total impulse. In plain English: the ideal model gives instantaneous “kicks”; the $\eta$-thickening turns them into brief, smooth pushes so standard ODE methods apply.

### **Core Principles**

-   **Superposition:** The potential fields from all sources superpose linearly. The net potential at any point is the sum of the individual potentials:
    $$
    \Phi_{\text{net}} = \sum_{i} \Phi_i
    $$
    The total acceleration on a particle at any instant is the vector sum of the accelerations from all intersecting expanding spherical shells. Operationally, every Architrino is continuously immersed in the superposed sphere streams of all others (and, when kinematics permit, its own); tractability comes from treating each causal hit independently with $1/r^2$ distance weighting, which makes local sources dominate.

-   **Velocity Dependence:** The dynamics are delayed-only and purely radial. Architrinos are transceivers: they emit potential spheres at a constant cadence and constant per-wavefront amplitude. The receiver’s speed does not change the instantaneous force magnitude; it affects only the work rate via $\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v} = |\mathbf{F}|\,v_r$. Self-interaction requires $|\mathbf{v}_a| > v$ at some emission times (super-field-speed), so the worldline outruns its recent shells; curvature alone is insufficient if $|\mathbf{v}_a|<v$ everywhere.

### **Self-Interaction**

A crucial dynamic arises from the possibility of self-interaction. An Architrino can intersect an expanding spherical shell that it emitted itself at an earlier point in its history. Self-interaction can occur when an Architrino’s speed has exceeded field speed ($|\mathbf{v}_a| > v$). In this regime, the particle moves ahead of previously emitted wavefronts, allowing it to interact with its own field. This self-interaction is always repulsive and plays a key role in the stability of emergent structures. In plain English: like a fast boat catching its own wake after turning, an Architrino can run into its earlier spheres and get a push away from its past positions.

### **Informational Ambiguity at the Receiver**

From the perspective of the receiving Architrino, the information carried by an intersecting potential sphere is limited. The receiver only knows two things:
1.  The net strength of the potential at the point of intersection.
2.  The unoriented line of action through its current position (i.e., one of the two open rays on that line); it does not know the orientation along that line.

It does not have direct knowledge of the source's identity, distance, or velocity. Consequently, a single received potential can have multiple possible origins. For example, a weak negative potential consistent with a given line of action could be produced by different configurations along that line at various distances.

This creates a more profound ambiguity: the receiver cannot distinguish between a negative potential from an Electrino on one side and a positive potential from a Positrino on the opposite side. An acceleration *towards* a point along the line of action could be interpreted as attraction to a Positrino at that point, or as repulsion from an Electrino located at the diametrically
opposite point on the same line.

Rest-frame recast (useful inference device): Any single hit can be equivalently described with a stationary emitter (|v|=0) placed somewhere along the same unoriented line of action, with the emitter’s actual speed at emission accounted for by an adjusted emission time and, if desired, a surrogate location along that line (a stationary, hypothetical source position chosen on the unoriented line to reproduce the same instantaneous hit). The per-wavefront amplitude remains constant in this recast; it does not depend on emitter speed.


This ambiguity is compounded by superposition. The net potential at any instant is the sum of all intersecting expanding spherical shells. A measured potential along a single radial could be the result of a complex confluence of fields from many different emitters located along that line of action, arriving from both directions.
