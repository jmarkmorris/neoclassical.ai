# Kinetic and Potential Energy

In this model, all energy is fundamentally tied to the Architrinos and the potential fields they generate. Architrinos are the sole carriers of kinetic energy through their motion and the source of potential energy through their interactions. All such dynamics unfold on a flat, non-dynamical background; forces and motion arise from fields and assemblies rather than any curvature of the background itself. We work in units with field speed $v=1$.

### Kinetic Energy and Momentum

An Architrino in motion possesses both kinetic energy and momentum.

-   **Kinetic Energy ($E_k$):** This is a scalar quantity representing the total energy of motion. It is a monotonically increasing function of the particle's speed, $|\mathbf{v}_a|$. As a free Architrino has no inherent speed limit, its kinetic energy is, in principle, unbounded.

-   **Momentum ($\mathbf{p}$):** This is the vector counterpart to kinetic energy, representing the directed energy of motion. Its magnitude is a function of speed, and its direction is aligned with the particle's velocity vector, $\mathbf{v}_a$.

Since mass is not a fundamental property in this model, neither kinetic energy nor momentum are defined in terms of it (e.g., $E_k \neq \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ and $\mathbf{p} \neq m\mathbf{v}$). They are considered intrinsic properties of a moving Architrino.

### Potential Energy and Interaction

Potential energy arises from the interaction of an Architrino with the potential fields generated by all other particles.

-   The net potential at any point in space, $\Phi_{\text{net}}$, is the linear superposition of the potentials from all intersecting spherical wavefronts at that point and instant.
-   The potential energy $U$ of a particle $o'$ with charge $q'$ at a position $\mathbf{s}$ is defined as:
    $$
    U(\mathbf{s}) = q' \Phi_{\text{net}}(\mathbf{s})
    $$
-   This is analogous to classical electrostatics, but here $\Phi_{\text{net}}$ is a dynamic quantity determined by the complete history of all source particles. The force experienced by the particle is given by the negative gradient of this potential energy: $\mathbf{F} = -\nabla U$. When a mollified field $\Phi_{\eta}$ is used (replacing surface deltas by narrow shells), this relation holds pointwise; in the $\eta\to 0$ limit, it holds in the sense of integrals over resolved intervals. The Master Equation of Motion remains the primary statement of dynamics.

### Energy Conservation and Exchange

The model adheres to the principle of energy conservation through a continuous exchange between kinetic and potential forms, governed by a fundamental feedback mechanism.

1.  **Work-Energy Exchange:** When a particle is accelerated by a potential field, the work done on it by the field's force results in a change in its kinetic energy. This change is balanced by a corresponding change in its potential energy as it moves through the field.
    $$
    \Delta E_k = W = \int \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{s} = -\Delta U
    $$


### Total Energy vs. Apparent Energy and Momentum

For composite systems (assemblies), it is essential to distinguish between the total internal energy and the apparent energy and momentum that govern the assembly's external interactions.

-   **Total Energy ($E_{total}$):** The total energy of an assembly is the sum of the kinetic energies of its constituent Architrinos plus the potential energy of their mutual interactions. For tightly bound systems like the Noether Core, this internal energy is immense.

-   **Apparent Energy and Momentum:** The apparent energy is what determines how the assembly interacts with the *external* universe. It is a measure of the assembly's residual, time-averaged external field. The apparent momentum of the assembly is the vector sum of the momenta of its constituents. For a stationary assembly, internal momenta cancel out, resulting in zero net momentum.

> **Energy Shielding**
> In stable assemblies like the **Noether Core**, the rapid internal motions of positive and negative Architrinos cause their emitted potential fields to largely cancel out via superposition. This "shields" the vast majority of the assembly's enormous internal energy from the outside world.

Inertia is therefore not a fundamental property of matter, but an **emergent property** of assemblies. It reflects the degree to which an assembly's total internal energy is shielded. The tiny, residual external field of a shielded assembly is what gives it its inertial properties and determines its momentum for a given group velocity. This concept provides a physical explanation for the hierarchy problem—why the observed inertial properties of particles are so much smaller than what might be expected from the Planck-scale energies involved in their fundamental structure. In plain language: inside a stable assembly, huge internal pushes mostly cancel; only a faint “whisper” leaks out, and that faint residue is what we perceive as inertia.
