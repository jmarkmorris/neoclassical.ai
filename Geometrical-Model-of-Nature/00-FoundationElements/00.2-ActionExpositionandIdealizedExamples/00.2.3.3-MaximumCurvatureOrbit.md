# 00.2.3.3 — Maximum Curvature: geometric bound, no-go for single-root orbits, and multi-hit conditions

We work in units with field speed $v=1$.

Executive summary
- Antipodal self-hit (Δ = π) is a sharp geometric/causal bound. It fixes the bound speed u⋆ = π/2 and gives a self chord equal to the diameter (2R). It is not a steady orbit.
- In the diametric two-body circle with only one partner-hit and one self-hit (“single-root picture”), the net tangential acceleration is strictly positive for all u>0; hence no constant-speed circle exists in this class.
- A steady circular orbit, if it exists, requires additional causal roots (multi-hit regime). The necessary conditions are (i) zero net tangential acceleration and (ii) inward radial balance equaling u²/R. These conditions can be written in closed form once the set of active roots is fixed.
- The partner emission can never be antipodal to the receiver; Δp = π is impossible. Thus “self at π, partner at 3π/2” (or any antipodal pair) cannot produce simultaneous radial-only forces.

Plain language: The “self at the opposite point” is a correct limit and gives u = π/2, but it is not a realized circular orbit because the partner still pushes tangentially. A true constant-speed circle would need more than one causal hit at a time to cancel the sideways push.

## Setup and notation (symmetric circular motion)

- Let each Architrino move at constant speed $u=\|\mathbf{v}\|$ on a circle of radius $R$ about the fixed origin, with angular speed $\omega = u/R$.
- At an observation time $t$, place particle 1 at angle $0$ and particle 2 at angle $\pi$ (diametrically opposite).
- A causal hit from an emission at time $t_0<t$ requires
  $$
  \text{chord distance between emission point and receiver now} \;=\; \tau,\qquad \tau=t-t_0,
  $$
  because $v=1$.

Elementary circle geometry:
- If the receiver has advanced by an angle $\Delta\theta=\omega\tau$ since emission, the chord length to its own earlier emission point is
  $$
  r_{\text{self}}(\Delta\theta)\;=\;2R\,\sin\!\Big(\frac{\Delta\theta}{2}\Big).
  $$
- If the partner has moved forward by $\Delta\theta_p=\omega\tau_p$ since its causal emission, the angle between the partner’s emission point and the receiver’s current position is $\alpha=\pi-\Delta\theta_p$, with chord
  $$
  r_{\text{part}}(\Delta\theta_p)\;=\;2R\,\sin\!\Big(\frac{\alpha}{2}\Big)
  \;=\;2R\,\cos\!\Big(\frac{\Delta\theta_p}{2}\Big).
  $$

Causality (sphere-radius equals chord) then gives the pair of transcendental constraints:
- Self-hit:
  $$
  2R\,\sin\!\Big(\frac{\Delta\theta}{2}\Big)\;=\;\tau\;=\;\frac{\Delta\theta}{\omega}
  \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
  2u\,\sin\!\Big(\frac{\Delta\theta}{2}\Big)\;=\;\Delta\theta.
  \qquad (S)
  $$
- Partner-hit:
  $$
  2R\,\cos\!\Big(\frac{\Delta\theta_p}{2}\Big)\;=\;\tau_p\;=\;\frac{\Delta\theta_p}{\omega}
  \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
  2u\,\cos\!\Big(\frac{\Delta\theta_p}{2}\Big)\;=\;\Delta\theta_p.
  \qquad (P)
  $$

These determine the angular separations of the causal emission points that act “now.”

## 1) Farthest possible self-emission in Euclidean distance is antipodal

Consider the self-hit chord
$$
r_{\text{self}}(\Delta\theta)=2R\sin\!\Big(\frac{\Delta\theta}{2}\Big),\qquad \Delta\theta\in(0,2\pi].
$$
- $r_{\text{self}}$ is strictly increasing on $(0,\pi]$ and strictly decreasing on $[\pi,2\pi]$.
- Hence the largest possible Euclidean separation between “now” and a historical point on the same circle is attained at $\Delta\theta=\pi$, with
  $$
  r_{\text{self,max}}=2R\quad\text{(diameter)}.
  $$

Because causality enforces $r_{\text{self}}=\tau$ with $v=1$, any self-hit that is “farther back in time” (larger $\tau$) must also have a chord that is at least as large. The diameter therefore upper-bounds the allowable self-hit travel time:
$$
\tau \le 2R.
$$
Equivalently, among all admissible self-hits on a circle, the antipodal emission ($\Delta\theta=\pi$) is the unique farthest-in-distance and thus the latest-in-time solution. No self-hit can originate from a historical point that is farther away in Euclidean distance than the antipode.

Plain language: the farthest point on a circle from where you are now is the opposite point; that’s the only way a self-emitted sphere can have the largest possible radius and still reach you now.

---

## 2) Saturation at the antipode fixes the speed

Impose the antipodal separation for the self-hit, $\Delta\theta=\pi$. Then (S) reads
$$
2u\,\sin\!\Big(\frac{\pi}{2}\Big)=\pi
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
2u=\pi
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\boxed{\,u_\star=\frac{\pi}{2}\,}.
$$
At this extreme, the causal data are:
$$
\Delta\theta_\star=\pi,\qquad
r_{\text{self},\star}=2R,\qquad
\tau_\star=\frac{\Delta\theta_\star}{\omega}=\frac{\pi}{u_\star/R}=2R.
$$

Direction check (maximal outward projection): the self line-of-action from the antipode to the receiver is exactly radial and outward at the receiver. Indeed, the angle between the self chord and the local radial outward direction equals
$$
\varphi=\frac{\pi}{2}-\frac{\Delta\theta}{2},
$$
so at $\Delta\theta=\pi$ one has $\varphi=0$, i.e., the entire self-hit acts along $+\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ at the receiver. This maximizes the outward radial component of self-repulsion.

Plain language: when your own earlier emission comes from the exact opposite point on the circle, the shove points straight outward and is as far back in time as geometry allows; that pins the speed to $u=\pi/2$.

---

## 3) Partner emission chord at the same “now”

For the oppositely charged partner, causal geometry yields (P):
$$
2u\,\cos\!\Big(\frac{\Delta\theta_p}{2}\Big)=\Delta\theta_p.
$$
At $u=u_\star=\pi/2$ this becomes
$$
\pi\,\cos\!\Big(\frac{\Delta\theta_p}{2}\Big)=\Delta\theta_p,
$$
which has a unique solution $\Delta\theta_p\in(0,\pi)$:
$$
\boxed{\,\Delta\theta_p \approx 1.866\ \text{rad}\ (\approx 107.0^\circ)\,}.
$$
Consequently,
$$
\boxed{\,r_{\text{part},\star}
=2R\cos\!\Big(\frac{\Delta\theta_p}{2}\Big)
\approx 2R\cos(0.933)
\approx 1.19\,R\,},
\qquad
\boxed{\,\tau_{p,\star}
=\frac{\Delta\theta_p}{\omega}
=\frac{\Delta\theta_p}{u_\star/R}
=\frac{2R}{\pi}\,\Delta\theta_p
\approx 1.19\,R\,}.
$$

Plain language: at the same instant, the partner’s useful emission came from a bit less than a quarter-turn behind it, giving a chord slightly larger than the radius and a flight time about $1.19$ orbital radii. Note: $\Delta\theta_p=\pi$ is impossible under (P), so the partner emission cannot be antipodal.

## 4) Why this is the maximum-curvature configuration

- Kinematic requirement for circular motion at speed $u$ and radius $R$ is a normal (radial) acceleration of magnitude $a_{\text{circ}}=u^2/R$.
- The canonical law gives per-hit accelerations strictly along their lines of action. In the symmetric circular state, the dominant contributors at any instant are:
  - partner attraction, nearly radial inward (from the partner’s historical position),
  - self-repulsion, radial outward when the self-hit is antipodal.
- Among all self-hits compatible with steady circular motion, the radial outward projection of self-repulsion is maximized at $\Delta\theta=\pi$ (proof above), and no self-hit can come from a farther historical point than the antipode ($r_{\text{self}}\le 2R$).
- Saturating the antipodal geometry forces $u=u_\star=\pi/2$. Any attempt to increase curvature beyond this (reduce $R$ while maintaining a steady circle) would require either (i) a self-hit from beyond the antipode (impossible in Euclidean geometry) or (ii) a larger radial projection than the antipodal alignment (also impossible since the antipodal line-of-action is already exactly radial at the receiver).

Hence, in the circular, diametrically opposed two-body configuration, the antipodal self-hit at $u_\star=\pi/2$ is the geometric and causal extremum; it is therefore the maximum-curvature orbit in this class.

Plain language: to keep the tightest possible circle, you want the outward self shove to line up perfectly with the radius and to come from as far back as geometry allows; that happens only for the opposite point on the circle, and it fixes the speed to $\pi/2$.

---

## 5) Summary of derived relations (v=1)

- Self-hit (general): $2u\sin(\Delta\theta/2)=\Delta\theta$.
- Farthest self-hit in distance: $\Delta\theta=\pi$ with chord $2R$ and flight time $\tau=2R$.
- Speed at the antipodal self-hit: $u_\star=\pi/2$.
- Partner-hit (general): $2u\cos(\Delta\theta_p/2)=\Delta\theta_p$.
- Partner data at $u_\star$:
  - $\Delta\theta_p\approx 1.866\ \text{rad}$,
  - partner chord $r_{\text{part},\star}\approx 1.19\,R$,
  - partner flight time $\tau_{p,\star}\approx 1.19\,R$.

Notes:
- These statements are purely geometric/causal (independent of coupling $\kappa$ and charge magnitudes). Dynamic closure (that the per-hit sums produce the required $a_{\text{circ}}=u^2/R$ at $u_\star$ and some $R$) involves the canonical $1/r^2$ law and superposition; in steady circular motion one interprets impulses in the $\eta\to 0$ limit via time-averaged radial components over a period.
- The antipodal result also maximizes the radial projection of the self-hit (full alignment) with no admissible self-hit at greater Euclidean separation, so it is a true extremum within the circular, diametric class.

## 6) Acceleration and work balance (radial/tangential)

We keep $v=1$ and the diametric two-body circle of radius $R$ and speed $u$ (angular speed $\omega=u/R$). Let $\Delta=\Delta\theta$ and $\Delta_p=\Delta\theta_p$ be the self- and partner-emission angular separations defined by the causal constraints
$$
2u\,\sin\!\Big(\frac{\Delta}{2}\Big)=\Delta\qquad(S),\qquad
2u\,\cos\!\Big(\frac{\Delta_p}{2}\Big)=\Delta_p\qquad(P).
$$
Define $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_c$ as the outward radial unit vector at the receiver and $\hat{\mathbf{t}}$ as the unit tangent in the direction of motion. Write $K=\kappa\,\epsilon^2>0$ (equal-magnitude charges $\pm\epsilon$).

Geometric projections at the receiver:
- Self (repulsion; acceleration along $+\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{\text{self}}$):
  $$
  r_{\text{self}}=2R\sin\!\Big(\frac{\Delta}{2}\Big),\quad
  \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{\text{self}}\!\cdot\!\hat{\mathbf{r}}_c=\sin\!\Big(\frac{\Delta}{2}\Big),\quad
  \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{\text{self}}\!\cdot\!\hat{\mathbf{t}}=\cos\!\Big(\frac{\Delta}{2}\Big).
  $$
- Partner (attraction; acceleration along $-\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{\text{part}}$):
  $$
  r_{\text{part}}=2R\cos\!\Big(\frac{\Delta_p}{2}\Big),\quad
  (-\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{\text{part}})\!\cdot\!\hat{\mathbf{r}}_c=\cos\!\Big(\frac{\Delta_p}{2}\Big),\quad
  (-\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{\text{part}})\!\cdot\!\hat{\mathbf{t}}=\sin\!\Big(\frac{\Delta_p}{2}\Big).
  $$

Per-hit magnitudes are $K/r^2$. Decomposing into components (take “inward” as positive radial, and “along motion” as positive tangential):

- Tangential components
  $$
  a_{\text{part},t}=\frac{K}{r_{\text{part}}^2}\,\sin\!\Big(\frac{\Delta_p}{2}\Big),\qquad
  a_{\text{self},t}=\frac{K}{r_{\text{self}}^2}\,\cos\!\Big(\frac{\Delta}{2}\Big).
  $$
- Radial components
  $$
  a_{\text{part},r}=+\frac{K}{r_{\text{part}}^2}\,\cos\!\Big(\frac{\Delta_p}{2}\Big),\qquad
  a_{\text{self},r}=-\frac{K}{r_{\text{self}}^2}\,\sin\!\Big(\frac{\Delta}{2}\Big),
  $$
  where the minus sign on $a_{\text{self},r}$ reflects that self-repulsion is outward (opposite to “inward positive”).

### Tangential zero-work condition (constant speed)
Steady constant speed requires the net tangential acceleration to vanish (sum also includes any additional causal roots if present):
$$
a_{\text{part},t}+a_{\text{self},t}+\sum_{\text{other roots}} a_{t}=0.
$$
In the single-root picture (one partner, one self), using $r_{\text{self}}=2R\sin(\Delta/2)$ and $r_{\text{part}}=2R\cos(\Delta_p/2)$, the $K$ and $R$ factors cancel and we obtain
$$
\boxed{\ \frac{\sin\!\big(\tfrac{\Delta_p}{2}\big)}{r_{\text{part}}^2}
+\frac{\cos\!\big(\tfrac{\Delta}{2}\big)}{r_{\text{self}}^2}=0\ }
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\boxed{\ \frac{1}{4R^2}\Big(\frac{\tan\!\big(\tfrac{\Delta_p}{2}\big)}{\cos\!\big(\tfrac{\Delta_p}{2}\big)}
+\frac{\cot\!\big(\tfrac{\Delta}{2}\big)}{\sin\!\big(\tfrac{\Delta}{2}\big)}\Big)=0\ }\quad(T)
$$
Qualitative consequences:
- If $u<\pi/2$, then $\Delta\in(0,\pi)$ and $\Delta_p\in(0,\pi)$, so both terms are positive; the net tangential component is positive and the orbit speeds up.
- At $u=\pi/2$, $\Delta=\pi$ so $a_{\text{self},t}=0$ while $a_{\text{part},t}>0$; still speeds up.
- For $u>\pi/2$, $\Delta\in(\pi,2\pi)$ so $\cos(\Delta/2)<0$ and $a_{\text{self},t}<0$. As $u\to\infty$, one has $\Delta\to 2\pi^-$ and $\Delta_p\to \pi^-$ with
  $$
  a_{\text{self},t}\sim -\,\frac{K}{R^2}\cdot\mathcal{O}(u^2)\ \to\ -\infty,\qquad
  a_{\text{part},t}\sim +\,\frac{K}{R^2}\cdot\mathcal{O}(u^2)\ (>0).
  $$
  In the single-root picture (one partner hit and one self hit), the net tangential sum is strictly positive for all $u$: at $u=\pi/2$ the self term vanishes while the partner term is positive; as $u\to\infty$, writing $\Delta=2\pi-2\alpha$ and $\Delta_p=\pi-2\beta$ with $\beta=\alpha/2$, one finds $a_{\text{part},t}\propto 1/\beta^2$ and $a_{\text{self},t}\propto -1/(4\alpha^2)$, so the sum remains $>0$. Hence (T) has no solution with only these two hits; constant-speed circles, if they exist, require additional causal roots (multi-hit).

Plain language: with only one partner and one self hit, the sideways pushes never cancel for any speed; zero tangential work demands extra (older) roots.

### Radial (centripetal) condition
A steady circle of radius $R$ must satisfy the inward radial balance
$$
a_{\text{part},r}+a_{\text{self},r}+\sum_{\text{other roots}} a_{r} \;=\; \frac{u^2}{R}.
$$
With one partner and one self root this gives
$$
\boxed{\ \frac{K}{4R^2}\Big(\frac{1}{\cos\!\big(\tfrac{\Delta_p}{2}\big)}-\frac{1}{\sin\!\big(\tfrac{\Delta}{2}\big)}\Big)\;=\;\frac{u^2}{R}\ }\quad(R)
$$
which determines $R$ once a tangentially balanced $u$ is found via (T) (with additional causal roots if needed). If additional causal roots are active, include their projections in both (T) and (R).

Plain language: First pick the (single) speed where the sideways pushes cancel; then the inward balance sets the circle’s radius.

### Relation to the antipodal (“maximum-curvature”) configuration
- $\Delta=\pi$ maximizes the radial alignment of the self-hit and saturates the geometric travel-time bound (self chord equals the diameter). This fixes $u_\star=\pi/2$ but leaves a strictly positive partner tangential term, hence not a constant-speed solution.
- The antipodal configuration is therefore a geometric extremum and a curvature bound, not the dynamical steady state. In the single-root picture no constant-speed circle exists; if a steady circle exists at all, it must include additional causal roots (multi-hit) to satisfy (T), and then (R) fixes $R$.

### Why a tangential hit is compatible with Step 5 (“no change to $v_\perp$ at a hit”)
In Step 5 the decomposition “$\mathbf{v} = v_r\,\hat{\mathbf{r}} + \mathbf{v}_\perp$” is taken with respect to the hit’s own line of action $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$. At a given hit, there is no instantaneous change orthogonal to that line. The circle’s tangent $\hat{\mathbf{t}}$ is generally not orthogonal to $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$, so a hit can (and generically does) have a nonzero projection along $\hat{\mathbf{t}}$. There is no contradiction.

Plain language: “No change to $v_\perp$” means “no change sideways to the line back to the emission point,” not “no change along the circle’s tangent.”
