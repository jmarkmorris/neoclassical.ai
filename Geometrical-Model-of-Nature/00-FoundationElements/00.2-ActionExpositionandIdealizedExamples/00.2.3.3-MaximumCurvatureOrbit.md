# 00.2.3.3 — Maximum-Curvature Circular Orbit (opposite charges)

Goal: characterize the circular, constant‑speed, constant‑radius configuration of two opposite Architrinos and ask where curvature κ = 1/R is maximized. We work in units with field speed v=1 and use the canonical delayed, purely radial per‑hit law.

Plain language: We look for the tightest (smallest‑R) steady circle an opposite‑charge pair can trace when the only pushes come from delayed, radial hits from the partner and from one’s own past emissions (self‑hits, active only when speed exceeds field speed).

## Setup and notation (symmetric frame)

- Two Architrinos with charges q1 = −ε and q2 = +ε; equal‑time positions are always diametrically opposite on a circle of radius R about the midpoint.
- Uniform circular motion with angular speed ω and constant speed s = Rω.
- Let δs and δp denote the angular phase between the receiver’s current position and the source’s emission position along the circle for self and partner, respectively:
  - Self (same particle): δs ≡ ωτs with delay τs; chord length rs = 2R sin(δs/2).
  - Partner (other particle): δp ≡ ωτp with delay τp; chord length rp = 2R cos(δp/2).
- Causal‑time (retarded) constraints (derived from r = τ with v=1):
  - Self: τs = 2R sin(δs/2) and δs = ωτs ⇒ δs = 2s sin(δs/2).
  - Partner: τp = 2R cos(δp/2) and δp = ωτp ⇒ δp = 2s cos(δp/2).

These two scalar equations determine (δs, δp) given s (provided s>1 so that self‑hits exist; see Walkthrough Step 8).

## Per‑hit directions and components

Choose local axes at the receiver: radial outward ê_r (from the rotation center) and tangential ê_t (direction of motion).

- Unit directions of the lines of action (source emission → receiver now):
  - Self: ˆu_s = (sin(δs/2)) ê_r + (cos(δs/2)) ê_t.
  - Partner (geometric chord): ˆu_p = (cos(δp/2)) ê_r − (sin(δp/2)) ê_t.
- Canonical per‑hit accelerations (magnitudes κ|q q′|/r² with signs):
  - Self is like‑on‑like (repulsive): a_s = + κ ε² r_s^{-2} ˆu_s.
  - Partner is unlike (attractive): a_p = − κ ε² r_p^{-2} ˆu_p.

Radial (inward taken as positive) and tangential components at an instant:

- r_s = 2R sin(δs/2), r_p = 2R cos(δp/2).
- Inward radial:
  - Self (repulsive, outward): A_s,rad = − κ ε² · [sin(δs/2)] / r_s² = − κ ε² / [4R² sin(δs/2)].
  - Partner (attractive, inward): A_p,rad = + κ ε² · [cos(δp/2)] / r_p² = + κ ε² / [4R² cos(δp/2)].
  - Net inward radial:
    $$
    A_{\text{rad}} = \frac{\kappa\,\epsilon^2}{4R^2}\Big(\frac{1}{\cos(\delta_p/2)} - \frac{1}{\sin(\delta_s/2)}\Big).
    $$
- Tangential (along ê_t, positive in direction of motion):
  - Self: T_s = + κ ε² · [cos(δs/2)] / r_s² = κ ε² · cos(δs/2) / [4R² sin²(δs/2)].
  - Partner: T_p = + κ ε² · [sin(δp/2)] / r_p² = κ ε² · sin(δp/2) / [4R² cos²(δp/2)].
  - Net tangential: T = T_s + T_p (both terms are nonnegative for 0<δs,δp<π).

Uniform circular motion requires, in a time‑averaged sense over a small window that resolves mollified shells (η>0):
- Centripetal balance: A_rad = s²/R.
- Zero power / constant speed: T = 0.

With only the principal self and partner roots present simultaneously, T>0 generically; in practice, tangential balance relies on the full set of causal roots (including older ones when they exist) and/or mollified accumulation over short windows (see Steps 6 and 10).

## What “maximum curvature” demands

For a steady circular orbit at speed s and radius R:
- You need a positive net inward radial A_rad = s²/R.
- You need vanishing net tangential T = 0 (no net power) once all causal roots over a short window are included.

From the component formulas,
- Inward radial increases if 1/ cos(δp/2) grows (partner emission more “ahead”) and/or 1/ sin(δs/2) shrinks (self emission not too “recent”). Near δs→0⁺ the self term blows up like 1/sin(δs/2), i.e., strong outward repulsion; hence “just‑above‑threshold” self‑hits do not maximize curvature—they strongly oppose it.

Because δs and δp are constrained by the retarded relations
$$
\delta_s = 2s\sin(\delta_s/2),\qquad \delta_p = 2s\cos(\delta_p/2),
$$
the pair (δs, δp) is not freely chosen; it depends on s. Maximum curvature (smallest R) at a given κ,ε occurs where the centripetal balance
$$
\frac{s^2}{R} \;=\; \frac{\kappa\,\epsilon^2}{4R^2}\Big(\frac{1}{\cos(\delta_p/2)} - \frac{1}{\sin(\delta_s/2)}\Big)
$$
is met with the smallest R while the zero‑power condition T=0 is satisfied by summing all available causal roots (principal + any older roots admitted by the geometry). This requires solving the full state‑dependent delayed system or its mollified variant.

## Practical recipe (computational)

1) Pick a speed s>1 (self‑hits active). Solve
   - δs = 2s sin(δs/2),
   - δp = 2s cos(δp/2),
   for (δs, δp) ∈ (0,π).

2) Enumerate all causal roots whose delays τ = r/v satisfy τ ≤ 2R over a short time window (principal roots always exist; older roots appear only if the geometry admits them). For each root, accumulate radial and tangential components with 1/r² weighting.

3) Find R such that
   - Centripetal: sum_rad(s, R) = s²/R,
   - Zero power: sum_tan(s, R) = 0.
   Use η‑mollification for smooth accumulation and solve the two conditions simultaneously.

4) Vary s and record the R that solves both conditions. The maximum curvature solution is the minimum R over s; report (s*, R*, δs*, δp*).

Notes:
- Near the self‑hit threshold (s↘1), the self radial term is large and outward (∝1/sin(δs/2)); tight circles are therefore not realized there.

## Summary answers

- Working hypothesis: the tightest steady circle occurs at a partner‑dominated retarded geometry (cos(δp/2) sufficiently larger than sin(δs/2)), achieved for some s>1 where additional causal roots (or mollified accumulation) cancel tangential power while leaving a positive net inward radial equal to s²/R. Determining (s*,R*) requires solving the coupled retarded constraints with the full root set.

Plain language: Maximum curvature occurs when the partner’s delayed pull dominates and tangential pushes cancel in the time‑average; no specific fixed offset angles are privileged.
