# 00.2.3.3 — Maximum-Curvature Circular Orbit (opposite charges)

Goal: characterize the circular, constant‑speed, constant‑radius configuration of two opposite Architrinos and ask where curvature κ = 1/R is maximized. We work in units with field speed v=1 and use the canonical delayed, purely radial per‑hit law.

Plain language: We look for the tightest (smallest‑R) steady circle an opposite‑charge pair can trace when the only pushes come from delayed, radial hits from the partner and from one’s own past emissions (self‑hits, active only when speed exceeds field speed).

---

## Setup and notation (symmetric frame)

- Two Architrinos with charges q1 = −ε and q2 = +ε; equal‑time positions are always diametrically opposite on a circle of radius R about the midpoint.
- Uniform circular motion with angular speed ω and constant speed s = Rω.
- Non-translating binary: the circle center (midpoint) is fixed in 3D Euclidean space; there is no net translational motion of the assembly.
- Let δs and δp denote the angular phase between the receiver’s current position and the source’s emission position along the circle for self and partner, respectively:
  - Self (same particle): δs ≡ ωτs with delay τs; chord length rs = 2R sin(δs/2).
  - Partner (other particle): δp ≡ ωτp with delay τp; chord length rp = 2R cos(δp/2).
- Causal‑time constraints (derived from r = τ with v=1):
  - Self: τs = 2R sin(δs/2) and δs = ωτs ⇒ δs = 2s sin(δs/2).
  - Partner: τp = 2R cos(δp/2) and δp = ωτp ⇒ δp = 2s cos(δp/2).

These two scalar equations determine (δs, δp) given s (provided s>1 so that self‑hits exist; see Walkthrough Step 8).

Terminology (root): At observation time t, a root is any emission time t0<t for which the causal‑distance constraint r = v(t − t0) holds between the receiver‑now and the source‑at‑t0. In uniform circular motion, roots correspond to angular separations δ that satisfy the delay equations; “older roots” are indexed by an integer m ≥ 0.

Integer‑indexed older roots (winding numbers):
- Let δ̃s ∈ (0, π] and δ̃p ∈ (0, π] denote the minimal angular separations at reception (principal separations that determine the chords).
- The full families of causal delays are
  - Self: δs(m) = 2s sin(δ̃s/2) + 2π m,
  - Partner: δp(m) = 2s cos(δ̃p/2) + 2π m,
  for m = 0,1,2,… (v=1 units).
- Geometric components (unit directions and 1/r²‑weighted magnitudes) depend only on the minimal separations δ̃s, δ̃p via the chords; the winding index m affects timing/ordering but not the sign of those components.

## Per‑hit directions and components

Choose local axes at the receiver: radial outward ê_r (from the rotation center) and tangential ê_t (direction of motion).

- Unit directions of the lines of action (source emission → receiver now):
  - Self: ˆu_s = (sin(δs/2)) ê_r + (cos(δs/2)) ê_t.
  - Partner (geometric chord): ˆu_p = (cos(δp/2)) ê_r − (sin(δp/2)) ê_t.
- Canonical per‑hit accelerations (magnitudes κ|q q′|/r² with signs):
  - Self is like‑on‑like (repulsive): a_s = + κ ε² r_s^{-2} ˆu_s.
  - Partner is unlike (attractive): a_p = − κ ε² r_p^{-2} ˆu_p.

Radial (inward taken as positive) and tangential components at an instant:

- r_s = 2R sin(δs/2), r_p = 2R cos(δp/2).
- Inward radial:
  - Self (repulsive, outward): A_s,rad = − κ ε² · [sin(δs/2)] / r_s² = − κ ε² / [4R² sin(δs/2)].
  - Partner (attractive, inward): A_p,rad = + κ ε² · [cos(δp/2)] / r_p² = + κ ε² / [4R² cos(δp/2)].
  - Net inward radial:
    $$
    A_{\text{rad}} = \frac{\kappa\,\epsilon^2}{4R^2}\Big(\frac{1}{\cos(\delta_p/2)} - \frac{1}{\sin(\delta_s/2)}\Big).
    $$
- Tangential (along ê_t, positive in direction of motion):
  - Self: T_s = + κ ε² · [cos(δs/2)] / r_s² = κ ε² · cos(δs/2) / [4R² sin²(δs/2)].
  - Partner: T_p = + κ ε² · [sin(δp/2)] / r_p² = κ ε² · sin(δp/2) / [4R² cos²(δp/2)].
  - Net tangential: T = T_s + T_p (both terms are nonnegative for 0<δs,δp<π).

Uniform circular motion requires, in a time‑averaged sense over a small window that resolves mollified shells (η>0):
- Centripetal balance: A_rad = s²/R.
- Zero power / constant speed: T = 0.

Non‑negativity of tangential components (obstruction): For the symmetric, non‑translating two‑body circle and any causal root (including older roots reduced to their minimal angular separations δ̃s, δ̃p ∈ (0, π]), the tangential components satisfy T_s ≥ 0 and T_p ≥ 0, hence T = T_s + T_p > 0 at any instant. Therefore an isolated two‑body cannot achieve T = 0; a true constant‑speed, fixed‑radius circle would require additional physics (e.g., external fields/assemblies or a modified interaction rule) to cancel tangential power.

## What “maximum curvature” demands

For a true constant‑speed circular orbit at speed s and radius R you would require both:
- Centripetal balance A_rad = s²/R, and
- Zero tangential power T = 0.
However, in the isolated, non‑translating two‑body case T>0 for all causal roots (see obstruction above). In what follows we therefore treat “maximum curvature” as a radial‑balance upper bound: enforce A_rad = s²/R while acknowledging T>0, and interpret the resulting smallest radius as a bound that could only be realized if some external mechanism were available to cancel tangential power.

From the component formulas,
- Inward radial increases if 1/ cos(δp/2) grows (partner emission more “ahead”) and/or 1/ sin(δs/2) shrinks (self emission not too “recent”). Near δs→0⁺ the self term blows up like 1/sin(δs/2), i.e., strong outward repulsion; hence “just‑above‑threshold” self‑hits do not maximize curvature—they strongly oppose it.

Because δs and δp are constrained by the causal history relations
$$
\delta_s = 2s\sin(\delta_s/2),\qquad \delta_p = 2s\cos(\delta_p/2),
$$
the pair (δs, δp) is determined by s (principal solutions with 0<δ<π; older roots reduce to these minimal angular separations for geometry). Define the radial‑balance upper‑bound radius R_bound(s) by
$$
\frac{s^2}{R} \;=\; \frac{\kappa\,\epsilon^2}{4R^2}\Big(\frac{1}{\cos(\delta_p/2)} - \frac{1}{\sin(\delta_s/2)}\Big),
$$
using δs, δp obtained from the principal delays at that s. For each s>1 this yields
$$
R_{\text{bound}}(s) \;=\; \frac{\kappa\,\epsilon^2}{4\,s^2}\Big(\frac{1}{\cos(\delta_p/2)} - \frac{1}{\sin(\delta_s/2)}\Big).
$$
The “maximum curvature” bound corresponds to the minimum of $R_{\text{bound}}(s)$ over $s>1$. Realizing this bound would additionally require a mechanism to cancel tangential power.

## Practical recipe (computational)

1) Pick a speed s>1 (self‑hits active). Solve
   - δs = 2s sin(δs/2),
   - δp = 2s cos(δp/2),
   for (δs, δp) ∈ (0,π).

2) Enumerate causal roots by integer index m ≥ 0 at the chosen s. Use the minimal angular separations δ̃s, δ̃p ∈ (0, π] (principal geometry) to compute chords and components; the winding index m only affects emission timing and arrival ordering. If desired, accumulate radial and tangential contributions with 1/r² weighting to verify that T(s) > 0.

3) Radial‑balance bound: find R such that
   - Centripetal: sum_rad(s, R) = s²/R.
   Record sum_tan(s, R) = T(s) > 0 to certify the obstruction to constant speed in the isolated two‑body case. Use η‑mollification for smooth accumulation.

4) Vary s and record $R_{\text{bound}}(s)$ from the radial balance. The maximum‑curvature bound is $\min_s R_{\text{bound}}(s)$; report the bounding tuple $(s_{\text{bound}}, R_{\text{bound}}, \delta_s(s_{\text{bound}}), \delta_p(s_{\text{bound}}))$ and state explicitly that realizing this bound would require an external mechanism to cancel tangential power.

Notes:
- Near the self‑hit threshold (s↘1), the self radial term is large and outward (∝1/sin(δs/2)); tight circles are therefore not realized there.

## Summary answers

- Isolated two‑body universe (non‑translating): A true constant‑speed, fixed‑radius circular state does not appear to exist under the canonical delayed, purely radial law with constant per‑wavefront amplitude. In the symmetric circle geometry all causal roots contribute non‑negative tangential power, so T(s)>0 and constant speed cannot be maintained without additional physics (external fields/assemblies or a modified interaction rule).
- Radial‑balance upper bound: One can still define a maximum‑curvature bound by enforcing centripetal balance and using the principal delay relations to obtain $R_{\text{bound}}(s) = \dfrac{\kappa\,\epsilon^2}{4 s^2}\Big(\dfrac{1}{\cos(\delta_p/2)} - \dfrac{1}{\sin(\delta_s/2)}\Big)$, then minimizing over $s>1$. This bound indicates how tight a steady circle could be if tangential power were canceled by an external mechanism.

Plain language: In the isolated pair, tangential pushes never cancel, so a steady circle is not available; the “maximum curvature” we compute here is a bound assuming some external help to remove tangential power.
