Detailed explanation (impulses vs smooth pushes):

- Measure-driven dynamics:
  - With exact surface deltas, dynamics are impulsive: velocities are functions of bounded variation with jump discontinuities at hit times.

- Mollified shells:
  - Replacing $\delta(\cdot)$ by a narrow Gaussian of width $\eta>0$ spreads each impulse into a short, smooth push, yielding classical $C^1$ trajectories for standard ODE solvers.

- Choosing η:
  - Select $\eta$ small relative to local geometric scales (path curvature radius, inter-source spacing) to approximate the event-driven picture while maintaining numerical stability.

- Energetic consistency:
  - On resolved intervals, the work–energy relation holds with $\Phi_\eta$; as $\eta\to 0$, interval integrals converge to the impulsive model.

Plain language: The ideal model gives instantaneous kicks; a tiny thickening turns them into brief, smooth nudges so you can integrate with ordinary ODE solvers.
