Detailed explanation (dynamical geometry):

- Field-speed units ($v=1$):
  - Choosing $L_0,T_0$ with $v=L_0/T_0=1$ fixes a conversion between spatial and temporal scales so that all speeds are dimensionless ratios to the field speed. This is akin to “setting c=1,” but the reference is the model’s field speed. Kinematics still lives on absolute time × Euclidean space; we have not mixed time and space into a 4D line element.
  - Consequence: every velocity appears as a pure number $|\mathbf{v}|$; the symmetry point “$|\mathbf{v}|=v$” becomes “$|\mathbf{v}|=1$.” Rescaling $L_0$ and $T_0$ together leaves all dimensionless predictions invariant.

- Coupling constant ($\kappa>0$):
  - $\kappa$ sets the overall scale of per-hit acceleration. In the canonical law,
    $
    \mathbf{a}_{o'\leftarrow o} = \kappa\,\sigma_{q_o q_{o'}}\,\dfrac{|q_o q_{o'}|}{r^2}\,\hat{\mathbf{r}},
    $
    larger $\kappa$ uniformly strengthens every interaction.
  - Scaling insight: if you scale $\kappa\mapsto \alpha\kappa$ while keeping $(\epsilon,\eta)$ fixed, accelerations scale by $\alpha$. Characteristic assembly scales such as the minimal binary radius $d_0$ and period $t_0$ shift accordingly through the dynamical balance that defines them.

- Regularization width ($\eta>0$):
  - $\eta$ is the thickness of the spherical shell used to mollify the surface delta $\delta(r-\tau)$. It converts impulsive hits into brief, smooth pushes so that standard ODE integration applies and pointwise quantities (like gradients) are well-defined.
  - Geometric guidance: choose $\eta$ small relative to local geometric scales (e.g., the receiver’s instantaneous curvature radius along its path and the local inter-source separation) so the regularized dynamics approximate the ideal event-driven picture while remaining numerically stable.

- Unit charge magnitude ($\epsilon>0$):
  - $\epsilon$ is the fundamental charge scale of an Architrino (Electrino $q=-\epsilon$, Positrino $q=+\epsilon$). In this framework $\epsilon$ is often identified with $|e|/6$, making quark charges integer multiples of $\epsilon$.
  - Per-wavefront amplitude and emission cadence are constant. The receiver’s speed does not additionally modulate the force magnitude.

- Sign of interaction ($\sigma_{q q'}$):
  - $\sigma_{q q'}=\mathrm{sign}(q\,q')$ selects attraction vs repulsion while keeping the acceleration strictly collinear with $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$. Like-on-like (σ=+1) points along +$\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ (repulsion); unlike (σ=-1) points along -$\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ (attraction).

- Line of action ($r$, $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$):
  - $r=\|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)-\mathbf{s}_o(t_0)\|$ is the separation between the receiver “now” and the source at its causal emission time. $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is the corresponding unit vector. All per-hit actions are purely radial along this line; no transverse/right-hand-rule terms appear.

- Combined role in assembly scales:
  - The trio $(\kappa,\epsilon,\eta)$, together with the $1/r^2$ law, determines emergent scales such as the smallest sustainable orbit $d_0$ and fastest natural frequency $2\pi/t_0$. Intuitively, stronger coupling (larger $\kappa\epsilon^2$) and thinner shells (smaller $\eta$) favor tighter, faster structures until self-interaction and delay balance inward trends.

Plain language: We measure speeds in units where the field speed is one, use κ to set how hard every hit pushes, use η to slightly thicken the razor-thin shells so calculus works, and use ε as the basic unit of charge. The push is always straight along the line back to where the sphere was emitted; like charges push out, unlike pull in.
