# Walkthrough Step 4 — Master equation of motion

Existing text excerpt:
> See 00.1.4 — Action.md for the canonical Master Equation of Motion (EOM), stated with emission time $t_0$ and delay $\tau=t-t_0$. This step unpacks the terms and conventions rather than restating the EOM.

Detailed explanation (terms and conventions):

- Direction and sign:
  - $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ points from the source’s historical position $\mathbf{s}_o(t_0)$ to the receiver’s current position $\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)$.
  - $\sigma_{q_o q_{o'}}=\mathrm{sign}(q_o q_{o'})$ selects repulsion for like charges and attraction for unlike.

- Scaling and normalization:
  - The per-hit magnitude falls as $1/r^2$ (surface density on spheres). All geometric constants (e.g., $1/(4\pi)$ and any Jacobians like $1/v$) are absorbed into $\kappa$ by convention.

- Receiver kinematics:
  - The receiver’s velocity does not change the instantaneous force magnitude; it only affects power through $\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{v}$ (see Step 5).

- Superposition:
  - Total acceleration is the sum over all sources and all causal roots (linearity at the level of shells).

- DDE view (causal functional form):
  - Let state $x = (\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{v})$. With $\eta>0$ regularization, the dynamics admit a causal functional form
    $$
    \frac{d x}{d t} = F\big(x(t), \{x_j(t - \tau_j)\}_j, t\big),
    $$
    with $\tau_j$ determined implicitly by $\|\mathbf{s}(t) - \mathbf{s}_j(t - \tau_j)\| = v\,\tau_j$, and per-hit contributions summed over all roots. In the $\eta\to 0$ limit interpret in the weak sense.

Plain language: For each earlier emission that can reach you now, push straight along the line back to where it came from, with strength set by the charges and the inverse-square distance.
