Absolute time flows uniformly and independently of space and any events within it. It is a one-dimensional continuum, ordered and linear. Its progression is **fixed and non-dynamical**, serving as a universal clock for all phenomena.

### **Mathematical Description**

1.  **Model (non-dimensionalized):** Time is modeled as the real number line:
    $$
    \mathbb{R}
    $$
    A specific instant is represented by a point $t \in \mathbb{R}$. Throughout, we non-dimensionalize time by choosing a reference timescale $T_0>0$ so that physical time $\hat{t}$ is given by
    $$
    \hat{t} = T_0\, t,
    $$
    making $t$ dimensionless. In plain language: we pick a time unit $T_0$ (say, “one tick”) and measure all times as pure numbers of ticks, which keeps equations clean and unit-consistent.

2.  **Linear Advancement:** Time progresses at a constant rate. The duration (interval) between two instants $t_1$ and $t_2$ is given by the distance:
    $$
    \Delta t = |t_2 - t_1|
    $$
    Correspondingly, physical duration satisfies
    $$
    \Delta \hat{t} = T_0\, \Delta t.
    $$

3.  **Time orientation:** We endow $\mathbb{R}$ with an orientation; “future” corresponds to increasing $t$ and “past” to decreasing $t$. The set of all instants is totally ordered. Any physical arrow of time (e.g., thermodynamic) is an emergent property, not a kinematic postulate.

4.  **Absolute Nature:** The time coordinate $t$ is universal. The duration $\Delta t$ between two events is the same for all observers, regardless of their position or motion.

5.  **No Absolute Origin and Completeness:** The choice of $t=0$ is arbitrary and serves only as a reference point. The timeline extends infinitely into the past ($t \to -\infty$) and future ($t \to +\infty$); as a manifold, $\mathbb{R}$ is connected and without endpoints.

6.  **Symmetries:** The kinematic symmetry group of time is the additive group $(\mathbb{R}, +)$ of time translations. At the kinematic level, time-reversal $t \mapsto -t$ is a symmetry; the chosen time orientation selects a direction for modeling but does not alter the invariance of the background structure.

Geodesics and dynamics: Time serves as a universal, non-dynamical parameter; forces and motion arise from fields and assemblies evolving in absolute space over time, not from any curvature or dynamics of the time background itself.

Causality: A precedes B iff $t_A < t_B$. Worldlines are monotone in $t$ (no closed causal loops). All interactions are delayed in $t$.
