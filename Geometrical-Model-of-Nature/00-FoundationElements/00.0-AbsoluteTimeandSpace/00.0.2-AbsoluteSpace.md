Absolute 3D Euclidean space is the geometric setting for physical phenomena, independent of time. It is a **static, flat, and non-dynamical** container where events take place. Its geometry is fixed and does not evolve.

A core assumption is that space is **homogeneous and isotropic**:
-   **Homogeneity**: There is no special or central point. Any location is equivalent to any other.
-   **Isotropy**: There is no preferred direction in space.

This implies there is no absolute origin; any chosen origin is merely a convenient reference for a coordinate system. Only differences (displacements) have geometric meaning; origins are gauge choices.

**Symmetry group:** The kinematic symmetry group of absolute space is the Euclidean group
$$
E(3) = \mathbb{R}^3 \rtimes SO(3).
$$
The geometry is homogeneous and isotropic under $E(3)$: translations and rotations act transitively without preferred locations or directions.

Here’s how to define it formally:

Note: We use $h_{ij}$ for the spatial metric throughout (see the Mathematical Style Guide).

### **1. Pure Math (metric space version)**
We model absolute space as the metric space:
$$
\mathbb{R}^3
$$
with coordinates $(x, y, z)$ and the Euclidean distance metric:
$$
d(\boldsymbol{p}, \boldsymbol{q}) = \sqrt{(x_p - x_q)^2 + (y_p - y_q)^2 + (z_p - z_q)^2}.
$$

In plain language: this is ordinary three-dimensional Euclidean space with the familiar straight-line distance formula.

### **2. Differential Geometry (Riemannian manifold version)**
We define space as the Riemannian manifold:
$$
(\mathbb{R}^3, h)
$$
with the flat metric tensor:
$$
h = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2
$$
This metric has a positive-definite signature $(+, +, +)$. The Riemann curvature tensor vanishes identically (flat space). The Levi-Civita connection is torsion-free, and its geodesics are straight lines (constant-velocity solutions in Cartesian coordinates). Plain language: there is no bending of space—triangles have 180°, and straight lines stay straight unless a force is applied.

### **3. Physics-Flavored (index notation)**
Coordinates: $x^i = (x, y, z)$, where the spatial index $i \in \{1,2,3\}$.
Metric:
$$
h_{ij} = \delta_{ij} \quad (\text{the Kronecker delta})
$$
The spatial line element is:
$$
ds^2 = \delta_{ij} \, dx^i dx^j = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2
$$

Properties and implications:
- Identity action: $\delta_{ij}$ acts as the identity; raising/lowering is trivial with $h^{ij}=\delta^{ij}$, so $v_i=\delta_{ij}v^j$ and $v^i=\delta^{ij}v_j$.
- Dot product and norm: $u\!\cdot\!v = g_{ij}u^i v^j$, $\|v\|^2 = g_{ij}v^i v^j$ (Euclidean).
- Connection: In Cartesian coordinates, $\Gamma^{i}{}_{jk}=0$; covariant derivatives equal partials and geodesics are straight.
- Curvature: $R^{i}{}_{jkl}=0$, $R_{ij}=0$, $R=0$ (flat).
- Measure and operators: $\sqrt{\det h}\,d^3x = dx\,dy\,dz$; $\Delta = h^{ij}\partial_i\partial_j = \partial_x^2+\partial_y^2+\partial_z^2$.
- Coordinates: In curvilinear frames (e.g., spherical), $h_{ij}$ takes the familiar flat-space form $\mathrm{diag}(1, r^2, r^2\sin^2\theta)$; $\delta_{ij}$ is specific to Cartesian frames.

---

### **4. Frames and Coordinates**
- Any Cartesian frame related by an element of $E(3)$ (translations and rotations) is physically equivalent. Quantities expressed in such frames transform in the usual tensorial way.
- Curvilinear coordinates (e.g., spherical, cylindrical) are allowed; the metric components transform accordingly from $g_{ij} = \delta_{ij}$, and all geometric statements remain coordinate-invariant.

---

### **5. Measure and Operators**
The standard volume element is
$$
dV = dx\, dy\, dz.
$$
For later PDE formulations, the Euclidean Laplacian is
$$
\Delta = \partial_x^2 + \partial_y^2 + \partial_z^2 = \delta^{ij}\,\partial_i\partial_j.
$$

Geodesics and dynamics: In this flat, non-dynamical space, geodesics are straight lines and do not encode forces; accelerations arise from fields and assemblies acting within this fixed Euclidean background, not from curvature of the background itself. Causality is not encoded by spatial geometry; it is supplied by the field propagation rule with finite speed $v$ ($c_{\max}$), as defined in the dynamics. All statements are coordinate-invariant under $E(3)$; only displacements are physical and origins are gauge choices.
