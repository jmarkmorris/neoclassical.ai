# Fermion Assemblies

## 0. Architecture, Notation, and Generational States

### 0.1 Tri-binary scaffold: H, M, L tiers

Each fermionic assembly is built on a **tri-binary scaffold**: three nested electrino–positrino binaries sharing a center but differing in radius, velocity, curvature, and energy:

- **H-binary (High)**  
  - Smallest radius  
  - Velocity \(v_H > V_f\) (field speed) → self-hit regime  
  - Highest curvature, highest intrinsic energy density  

- **M-binary (Medium)**  
  - Intermediate radius  
  - Velocity \(v_M = V_f\)  
  - Symmetry-breaking “pivot” scale  

- **L-binary (Low)**  
  - Largest radius  
  - Velocity \(v_L < V_f\)  
  - Lowest curvature, outer “envelope” / expansion–contraction behavior  

Each binary defines one **axis** with two polar sites (poles), giving **6 personality slots** per tri-binary.

**Personality charges:**

- Electrino: \(-e/6\)  
- Positrino: \(+e/6\)

On each axis we can have patterns like:
- \((-\!/-), (+/+), (-/+)\) etc.

We will refer to the three axes simply as **H, M, L axes**.

---

### 0.2 Generational excitation states

We separate **tri-binary presence** from **Standard Model “generation” labels**:

- **Gen-I (ground-state tri-binary)**  
  - All three binaries **assembled and coherent**: [H, M, L]  
  - This is the base for first-generation fermions (e, ν, u, d) in their low-energy form.

- **Gen-II (first excitation)**  
  - Only **H and M** binaries assembled: [H, M]  
  - L-binary is **unassembled** or energetically inaccessible.  
  - Outer screening layer is absent → H/M core more exposed.

- **Gen-III (second excitation)**  
  - Only **H** binary assembled: [H]  
  - Both M and L absent as stable binaries → naked self-hit core, very reactive.

We avoid calling this a “decay chain.” Instead:

> Higher generations are **higher-energy excitation states of the same underlying tri-binary topology**, with fewer coherent outer layers. They require energy input to populate and typically relax back down by emitting W/Z/γ/ν etc.

In this section, color is defined **on Gen-I tri-binaries**, then extended conceptually to higher generations via their remaining axes.

---

### 0.3 Matter vs antimatter: braid orientation

Beyond “what binaries exist,” there is braid orientation:

- Matter tri-binary precession:  
  - Braid order \(H \to M \to L\) (one chirality).
- Antimatter tri-binary precession:  
  - Braid order \(H \to L \to M\) (opposite chirality).

This **braid chirality** is our fundamental distinction between proton-like vs anti-proton-like scaffolds. In this color section, we treat color as **independent of braid orientation** (vector-like), so that the strong force is parity-symmetric; braid will matter later for CP and baryogenesis.

---

## 1. Colorless Fermions: Axis Uniformity

Color charge in this framework is tied to **axis asymmetry**. If all three axes carry the same personality pattern, there is no “which axis is special?” degree of freedom → **no color**.

### 1.1 Electron and positron

- **Electron**:
  \[
  (\text{H}, \text{M}, \text{L}) = (-/-,\ -/- ,\ -/-)
  \]
  Each axis: net \(-2 e/6\) → total \(-6 e/6 = -e\).  
  All axes identical → **SU(3)\(_c\) singlet → colorless**.

- **Positron**:
  \[
  (+/+,\ +/+,\ +/+)
  \]
  Mirror of electron, all axes identical → colorless.

### 1.2 Neutrino tri-binaries

A canonical neutrino pattern:
\[
(-/+,\ -/+,\ -/+)
\]

- Each axis: one electrino, one positrino, net 0.  
- All axes identical → colorless.

Other neutral patterns, like:
\[
(+/+,\ -/+,\ -/-) \quad \text{and permutations}
\]
also have net 0 charge (3e + 3p), but differ in **axis personality contrast**.

We treat these as **candidate neutrino mass eigenstates**, each a different internal H/M/L pattern, but **still colorless** because no axis is “exceptional” in a way that couples to SU(3)\(_c\). Neutrino oscillation is then hypothesized to arise from slow precession (wobble) between such internal configurations; a quantitative PMNS-like treatment is deferred to the neutrino section.

> **Key rule:**  
> If H, M, and L axes share the same personality pattern, the assembly is an SU(3)\(_c\) singlet. Gluon-like axis-reconfiguration operations act trivially → no strong interaction.

Electroweak charges and chiral structure act on different internal aspects (e.g., braid chirality, planar vs ellipsoidal modes) and will be treated in the Electroweak section.

---

## 2. Quarks as Axis-Exceptional Fermions

Quarks carry color because **one of the three axes is “exceptional” relative to the other two**.

### 2.1 General rule: exceptional axis = color

On a given tri-binary, define:

- A **background pattern**: personality pattern shared by two axes.  
- An **exceptional pattern**: the pattern of the third, distinct axis.

**Definition (color degree of freedom):**

> The color state of a quark is determined by **which axis (H,M,L) carries the exceptional pattern**.

This gives a 3-state internal space:

- Exceptional on H  
- Exceptional on M  
- Exceptional on L  

We use the basis:
\[
|q_H\rangle,\ |q_M\rangle,\ |q_L\rangle
\]

This is the **fundamental color triplet space,** \(\mathcal{H}^{\text{color}}_q \cong \mathbb{C}^3\).  
We’ll map this to standard QCD triplet components later as \(|q_1\rangle,|q_2\rangle,|q_3\rangle\). The association to QCD’s named “red/green/blue” is conventional at this stage.

**Important selection rule:**  
We do **not** allow stable states where **all three axes have different personality patterns** (e.g. H: +/+, M: -/-, L: -/+). Such states have no well-defined background vs exceptional pattern and are assumed to be dynamically unstable in the vacuum tri-binary sea; they relax into one of the allowed “two same + one different” configurations or disintegrate. This avoids a proliferation of non-SM color structures.

---

## 3. Up-type Quarks (5/1 Personality Content)

Up-type quarks (u, c, t in their Gen-I form) have:

- 5 positrinos, 1 electrino → (5p, 1e).

At axis level, they look like:

- Two axes: background \((+\!/+)\) (pure positrino).  
- One axis: exceptional (contains the single electrino in a mixed pattern, e.g. \((-\!/+)\)).

We *ignore* which pole on the exceptional axis hosts the electrino for color; that is an internal dipole detail. For color, we only care about which **axis** is exceptional.

**Color basis for an up-type flavor \(u\):**

- \(|u_H\rangle\): H axis hosts the single electrino (exceptional).  
- \(|u_M\rangle\): M axis is exceptional.  
- \(|u_L\rangle\): L axis is exceptional.

Color space:
\[
\mathcal{H}^{\text{color}}_u = \text{span}\{|u_H\rangle,\ |u_M\rangle,\ |u_L\rangle\} \cong \mathbb{C}^3.
\]

Pole flips on a given axis (swapping which pole hosts e) change multipole structure but not which axis is exceptional; at the color level we treat that as an **internal gauge freedom**.

Anti-up quark uses an anti-tri-binary (5e,1p) with braid order reversed; color space is the usual conjugate representation 3̄, with basis \(|\bar u_H\rangle, |\bar u_M\rangle,|\bar u_L\rangle\).

---

## 4. Down-type Quarks (4/2 Personality Content)

Down-type quarks (d, s, b in their Gen-I form) have:

- 4 electrinos, 2 positrinos → (4e, 2p).

At the axis level, all allowed net-neutral patterns respecting total 4e/2p group into two families:

### 4.1 Family I — “one +/+ axis, two −/− axes”

Patterns written (H,M,L):

- (A) \((-\!/- ,\ -/- ,\ +/+)\)  
- (B) \((-\!/- ,\ +/+ ,\ -/-)\)  
- (C) \((+\!/+ ,\ -/- ,\ -/-)\)

Here:
- Background pattern: \((-\!/-)\) (pure electrino).  
- Exceptional pattern: \((+\!/+)\) (pure positrino).

### 4.2 Family II — “one −/− axis, two mixed axes”

- (D) \((-\!/+, -/+ ,\ -/-)\)  
- (E) \((-\!/+, -/- ,\ -/+)\)  
- (F) \((-\!/- , -/+ ,\ -/+)\)

Here:
- Background pattern: \((-\!/+)\) (mixed, dipolar).  
- Exceptional pattern: \((-\!/-)\) (pure electrino).

In **both** families, the structural pattern is:

> Two axes in a background pattern, one in a distinct exceptional pattern.

Thus, for any down-type flavor \(d\), we again define:

- \(|d_H\rangle\): H exceptional  
- \(|d_M\rangle\): M exceptional  
- \(|d_L\rangle\): L exceptional

regardless of whether “exceptional” is +/+ or -/-. So:
\[
\mathcal{H}^{\text{color}}_d = \text{span}\{|d_H\rangle,\ |d_M\rangle,\ |d_L\rangle\} \cong \mathbb{C}^3.
\]

**Family selection (d/s/b):**  
Dynamics must decide which family is realized for each flavor and in each environment:

- **Working hypothesis (to be tested):**
  - Ground-state down quark \(d\) in low-energy baryons uses **one specific family** (e.g. Family II, the more “stealth” mixed pattern), selected by minimizing coupling energy with the vacuum tri-binary sea.
  - Strange \(s\) and bottom \(b\) may favor different families or different internal pattern mixes as part of their higher mass / coupling differences.
- **Failure mode:** If both families were independently stable and long-lived for a given flavor, we’d predict extra down-like states (beyond d/s/b). That is not observed, so the dynamics must select.

This is a key place where nuclear and hadron spectroscopy will constrain the model.

## 5. Color Hilbert Space and SU(3) Action

For any quark flavor \(q\), we have the color triplet:

\[
|q\rangle_{\text{color}} =
\begin{pmatrix}
q_H\\
q_M\\
q_L
\end{pmatrix}
\in \mathbb{C}^3.
\]

We now specify the **allowed internal transformations**:

- Preserve:
  - Total electrino/positrino count (6 slots fixed),  
  - Net EM charge,  
  - Exactly one axis being exceptional.
- But **mix** which axis is exceptional and their internal phases.

These transformations must:

1. Be **unitary** on \(\mathbb{C}^3\) (probability conservation in color).  
2. Have **determinant 1** once we remove a purely global phase that has no observable effect.

This defines an internal symmetry group:
\[
G_{\text{color}} \cong SU(3).
\]

### 5.1 U(3) vs SU(3): why drop the overall phase?

The full group of 3×3 unitary transformations is U(3) = SU(3) × U(1). The extra U(1) corresponds to multiplying all components \((q_H,q_M,q_L)\) by the same phase:

\[
|q\rangle \to e^{i\theta}|q\rangle.
\]

In the tri-binary ontology:

- Only **relative phases** between H, M, and L axes affect which axis is exceptional and how binaries couple to spacetime assemblies.  
- A common phase shift of all three axes corresponds to a redefinition of the internal color-phase reference, not a spatial rotation of the scaffold or a change in any observable pattern.

We therefore treat this global phase as a **gauge redundancy** of the color description, not a physical degree of freedom, and quotient it out:

> **Color symmetry group** = SU(3): unitary, determinant-1 transformations on \(|q_H,q_M,q_L\rangle\).

### 5.2 One explicit generator (example)

Identify \(|q_H\rangle,|q_M\rangle,|q_L\rangle\) with the standard basis \(|q_1\rangle,|q_2\rangle,|q_3\rangle\). Consider the generator that exchanges H and M “exceptional roles”:

\[
T_{HM} \propto
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Acting on the color state:

- Takes \(|q_H\rangle \leftrightarrow |q_M\rangle\), leaves \(|q_L\rangle\) unchanged.

Geometrically: an infinitesimal version of this corresponds to a continuous deformation that transfers “exceptional” status between H and M axes, preserving personality counts and total charge.

Together with analogous generators for (H↔L), (M↔L) and suitable phase generators (diagonal matrices), we span the full su(3) Lie algebra; in conventional QCD notation these are the Gell-Mann matrices.

> **Mapping to QCD notation:**  
> The vector \((q_H,q_M,q_L)^T\) is the fundamental triplet \((q_1,q_2,q_3)^T\). The usual Gell-Mann matrices \(\lambda^a\) act on this space; we interpret them as specific combinations of axis swap and phase operations on H/M/L exceptionalities.

## 6. Gluons as Axis-Reconfiguration Braids in the Medium

Gluons are not standalone point particles here; they are **localized excitations of the spacetime tri-binary medium** that implement the SU(3) transformations between quark color states.

### 6.1 Quark–quark axis coupling and 9-axis braid

In a Gen-I baryon:

- 3 quarks × 3 axes each → **9 axes**: H₁,M₁,L₁; H₂,M₂,L₂; H₃,M₃,L₃.  
- 18 scaffold architrinos in binary orbits (3 quarks × 3 binaries × 2), plus  
- 18 personality architrinos decorating the 6 poles per quark.  
- Total: **36 architrinos** in the nucleon assembly.

A **color singlet baryon** corresponds to a configuration where:

- These 9 axes form a **closed network of couplings** (a closed braid in axis space) such that:
  - Each of the three regimes H, M, L is “exceptional once” across the three quarks,  
  - No binary regime is globally preferred in the composite,  
  - Net axis-imbalanced color flux to the vacuum is zero.

**Example (schematic proton uud):**

- Quark 1 (u): exceptional on H → \(|u_H\rangle\)  
- Quark 2 (u): exceptional on M → \(|u_M\rangle\)  
- Quark 3 (d): exceptional on L → \(|d_L\rangle\)

In SU(3) representation language, this is one component of the antisymmetric color singlet (ε_{ijk} q^i q^j q^k). In the tri-binary picture, it means:

- H, M, and L exceptionalities are each realized once → at large distance, H/M/L-dependent multipoles cancel, leaving only isotropic monopole contributions (electric charge, mass, baryon number).

This underlies why protons source an **isotropic long-range effective field** in the low-energy limit (no residual color anisotropy).

### 6.2 What a gluon is geometrically

A gluon exchange between two quarks corresponds to:

- A **temporary bridge** between two axes (one on each quark) mediated by the spacetime tri-binary sea. For example:
  - H₁ axis of quark A couples to M₂ axis of quark B.
- This bridge is a braid-like distortion in vacuum tri-binaries along the line connecting those axes, reassigning exceptional status:
  - \(|q_H\rangle \to |q_M\rangle\) on quark A  
  - \(|q_M\rangle \to |q_H\rangle\) on quark B

The full set of such operations (axis swaps + phase rotations) that preserve color singlet of the whole baryon yields the **8 gluon modes** (SU(3) adjoint).

**Self-interaction:**  
Because these axis-reconfiguration patterns exist in the medium itself, two gluon-like excitations can interact (their braids tangle), reproducing qualitatively the 3-gluon and 4-gluon vertices of non-Abelian Yang–Mills. A gluon–gluon bound knot in the vacuum corresponds to a **glueball** in QCD language. Details of this will be given in the gauge-boson section.

### 6.3 Flux tubes as non-closed braids

A **color flux tube** between two colored objects corresponds to:

- A narrow bundle of spacetime tri-binaries whose H/M/L axis phases are locked into a **non-singlet configuration** along a line: the braid **cannot close locally**.
- The surrounding vacuum is in a singlet (closed braid) state, so maintaining this line of non-closure costs energy per unit length.

We then expect:

- At small separations: flux is still localized near the pair; energy ∼ constant + corrections.  
- At large separations: maintaining a long line of distorted, non-singlet assemblies gives approximately **linear energy growth**:
  \[
  E(r) \sim \sigma\, r
  \]
  where \(\sigma\) is an effective string tension set by:
  - Energy scale of vacuum tri-binaries (H-scale)  
  - Their spatial density (characteristic spacing)

Dimensional argument (to be refined):

- If one vacuum tri-binary distortion costs \(\sim 1 \text{ GeV}\), spaced at \(\sim 1 \text{ fm}\), then:
  \[
  \sigma \sim \frac{1\ \text{GeV}}{1\ \text{fm}} \approx 1\ \text{GeV/fm}
  \]
  matching the known QCD string tension order of magnitude. A full computation will be part of the Strong Dynamics section.

**Falsifiability:**  
If static color-source energy E(r) in this model does **not** rise approximately linearly beyond some scale, or yields the wrong σ scale, this braid-flux-tube picture fails.

---

## 7. Colorless vs Colored, and Residual Strong Force

- **Leptons:** colorless; all axes identical; no open braids in color space → no coupling to gluons.  
- **Quarks:** colored; one axis exceptional; gluons mediate reconfiguration of that exceptional axis between quarks.

**Residual strong force (nuclear binding):**

Even though a nucleon is color singlet, its internal H/M/L structure and down-quark pattern family affect:

- How perfectly the 9-axis braid closes at nuclear distances.  
- How outer L-binaries of neighboring nucleons overlap and couple.

Qualitatively:

> Residual strong force between nucleons arises from **imperfect screening** of H/M/L axis structures when color-singlet nucleons are brought within ~1–2 fm: outer L (and partly M) axes of different nucleons start to couple, effectively mimicking meson exchange (Yukawa-like potential).

This residual is what binds nuclei; it will be modeled in detail in the nuclear section.

---

## 8. Summary and Outlook

- A Gen-I fermion is a tri-binary [H,M,L] with 6 personality slots; **color** is present iff one axis is in a distinct personality class from the other two.
- Leptons: all three axes with identical personality patterns → **SU(3)\(_c\) singlets**.  
- Quarks: exactly one axis exceptional → **color triplets**:
  - Up-type (5p,1e): exceptional = axis hosting the single electrino.  
  - Down-type (4e,2p): exceptional = axis whose personality class differs from the other two (Family I/II).
- For each quark flavor: color space \(\mathbb{C}^3\) with basis \(|q_H\rangle,|q_M\rangle,|q_L\rangle\).  
- **SU(3)\(_c\)** is the group of unitary, det-1 transformations mixing which axis is exceptional and their phases, modulo a global unobservable phase.  
- Gluons are localized braid-like excitations in the spacetime tri-binary medium that implement these axis-reconfiguration operations between quarks; their collective modes form the 8-dimensional adjoint representation.
- Color singlet hadrons correspond to **closed braids** in the 9-axis network (baryons) or quark–antiquark pairs (mesons); non-singlets force **open braids**, i.e. flux tubes in the vacuum medium, with energy rising ~ linearly with separation.

This is the scaffold we’ll now use to:

- Map explicitly onto QCD notation (Lagrangian, Gell-Mann matrices, color factors).  
- Derive confinement scale and running coupling behavior from tri-binary dynamics.  
- Predict how down-quark pattern families and axis regimes H/M/L leave imprints on hadron spectra, nuclear binding, and possibly early-universe QCD thermodynamics.
