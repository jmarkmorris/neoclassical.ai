# Geometrical Model of Nature
> Original Theory by J Mark Morris

## Overview

The **Geometrical Model of Nature** is an independent theoretical framework developed by J Mark Morris that seeks to understand the fundamental structure of reality through geometric principles and point object dynamics. This theory was developed independently from Delta Theory and represents a distinct approach to modeling natural phenomena.

## Core Principles

The theory is built upon three fundamental types of entities expressed geometrically:

1. **Three-dimensional Euclidean space** - A continuous vessel through which point objects travel
2. **Single dimension of time** - Linear temporal progression
3. **Population of point objects** - Fundamental entities with specific properties and behaviors

## Theoretical Foundation

### Timespace Manifold
- Defined as $\mathcal{M} = \mathbb{R}_t \times \mathbb{R}^3_x$
- Continuous, differentiable, and unbounded manifold
- No non-degenerate 4D metric; background is absolute time Ã— Euclidean 3-space; no privileged origin or coordinate system
- All structures are emergent

### Point Objects
- Constant rate emitters of scalar potential $\phi$
- Binary polarity: positrino (+1) or electrino (-1)
- Traverse continuous paths through $\mathbb{R}^4$
- Possess kinetic and potential energy
- Have unique provenance (non-interchangeable, non-destructible)

### Emission Dynamics
- Spherical potential field expansion at field speed $v$
- Potential magnitude follows $|\phi(r)| \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$
- Action occurs through field intersection and superposition

### Assembly Theory
- Binary assemblies form the most basic stable structures
- Recursive nesting enables complex emergent phenomena
- All assemblies reducible to subassemblies

## Integration Status

**Current Status**: **Non-integrated** with Delta Theory

This theory exists as an independent framework within the Delta Theory repository. While both theories share interests in recursive structures and emergent phenomena, they were developed independently and maintain distinct ontological foundations.

**Future Integration**: Plans exist to explore potential theoretical bridges and integration pathways between the Geometrical Model of Nature and Delta Theory. This integration work will:

- Identify conceptual correspondences between the theories
- Explore potential unified mathematical frameworks
- Develop translation mechanisms between their respective ontologies
- Maintain the integrity of both theoretical approaches

## Author

**J Mark Morris** - Original developer and primary theorist of the Geometrical Model of Nature. This work represents his independent contribution to fundamental physics and geometric modeling of natural phenomena.

## Relationship to Delta Theory

While housed within the Delta Theory repository for collaborative purposes, the Geometrical Model of Nature maintains its theoretical independence. Both theories:

- Explore recursive and emergent phenomena
- Seek fundamental explanations of natural structure
- Employ mathematical formalization
- Consider the role of difference and relationship in reality

The co-location of these theories enables future collaborative development while preserving their distinct theoretical identities.
