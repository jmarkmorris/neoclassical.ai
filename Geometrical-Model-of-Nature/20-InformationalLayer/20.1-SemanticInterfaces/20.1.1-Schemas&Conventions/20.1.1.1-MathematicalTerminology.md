| Symbol / Term | Meaning in this project | Extended explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $\mathcal{M} = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3$ | Absolute timespace: global, oriented time × Euclidean 3-space; no non-degenerate 4D metric. | Treat as a product manifold with a global time coordinate and a flat 3D Riemannian metric; differential operators split into time derivatives d/dt and spatial operators on slices $\Sigma_t$. Worldlines are ODEs in $t$, and fields are distributions on $\Sigma_t$ parametrized by $t$. |
| $t$ | Absolute time (dimensionless after choosing $T_0$); increases globally. | Single global independent variable for dynamics. After selecting $T_0$, $t$ is dimensionless; derivatives w.r.t. $t$ define $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{a}$. Monotonicity enforces causal order and precludes closed time loops. |
| $\Sigma_t$ | Simultaneity slice at time $t$: $\{t\} \times \mathbb{R}^3$. | A 3D hypersurface carrying $h_{ij}$ and volume element $dV$; gradients, divergences, and Laplacians act within $\Sigma_t$. Spacetime integrals use $dt\,dV$. |
| $h_{ij} = \delta_{ij}$ | Euclidean spatial metric on $\Sigma_t$; implements dot products and norms. | Flat metric used for inner products and norms; in spherical coordinates it becomes $\mathrm{diag}(1,r^2,r^2\sin^2\theta)$. Raising/lowering is trivial with $h^{ij}=\delta^{ij}$. |
| $\mathbf{x},\, \mathbf{s}$ | Spatial position vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$; vectors are bold, e.g., $\mathbf{s}(t)$. | Spatial vectors valued in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The worldline $\mathbf{s}(t)$ is assumed absolutely continuous so $\mathbf{v}=d\mathbf{s}/dt$ exists a.e.; we do not assemble 4-vectors. |
| $\mathbf{v} = d\mathbf{s}/dt,\ \mathbf{a} = d\mathbf{v}/dt$ | Velocity and acceleration vectors (boldface by convention). | Kinematic derivatives with respect to $t$. Under impulsive forces $\mathbf{v}$ has bounded variation; with mollification ($\eta>0$) both $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{a}$ are continuous and classical ODE theory applies. |
| $\lVert\cdot\rVert$ | Euclidean norm (length) induced by $h_{ij}$. | The norm induced by $h$; used for separations $r$, speeds, and lengths; coordinate-independent. |
| hat (ˆ) | Unit vector; e.g., $\hat{\mathbf{r}} = \mathbf{r}/\lVert\mathbf{r}\rVert$. | Normalization to unit length. $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ fixes the line of action. At $r=0$ the direction is undefined; such center hits contribute no net push by symmetry. |
| $v$ (field speed) | Propagation speed of spherical shells; set to $1$ by units ($v=1$). | Fixed propagation speed for shells. Nondimensionalization sets $v=1$ so speeds are pure numbers; it bounds signal propagation ($c_{\max}$) and appears in the constraint $r=v(t-t_0)$ and in delta change-of-variables. |
| $\kappa > 0$ | Universal coupling constant (absorbs geometric normalizations). | A scale factor absorbing geometric constants (e.g., $4\pi$, $1/v$ Jacobians). Varying $\kappa$ rescales all per-hit accelerations and shifts emergent scales such as $d_0$ and $t_0$. |
| $\epsilon > 0$ | Unit charge magnitude; identified with $\lvert e\rvert/6$. | Fundamental charge magnitude for Architrinos. Identifying $\epsilon$ with the magnitude of $e$ divided by 6 makes observed quark charges become integers in units of $\epsilon$, simplifying conservation. |
| $q,\, q'$ | Intrinsic architrino charges for source and receiver (each equals $\pm\epsilon$). | Intrinsic, fixed signs $\pm\epsilon$ for source and receiver. They enter accelerations through the magnitude of $q q'$ and the sign $\sigma_{q q'}$. |
| $\sigma_{q q'} = \mathrm{sign}(q\,q')$ | Interaction sign: $+1$ like-on-like (repulsion), $-1$ unlike (attraction). | The signum of $q q'$. It selects repulsion vs. attraction by multiplying the radial unit vector in the EOM. |
| $r,\, \hat{\mathbf{r}}$ | Separation and radial direction from the source’s emission position to the receiver at time $t$ (“now”). | $r$ is the Euclidean distance between receiver-now and source-at-$t_0$; $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is the associated unit vector. The $1/r^2$ factor reflects shell surface density. |
| $t_0,\ \tau = t - t_0$ | Causal emission time and delay to reception. | $t_0$ labels a causally connected emission; $\tau=t-t_0$ is the travel time. Both appear in the root condition and in distributional expressions. |
| $\mathcal{C}_j(t)$ | Causal set of emission times of source $j$ that reach the receiver at time $t$. | The set of solutions of $F(t_0;t)=\lVert\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)-\mathbf{s}_j(t_0)\rVert - v(t-t_0)=0$ with $t_0 < t$. For $\lVert\mathbf{v}_j\rVert<v$ and transverse crossings, a unique smooth branch follows from the implicit function theorem; multiple roots can occur otherwise. |
| $\delta(r - v\tau),\ \delta_{S_r}$ | Surface delta on expanding shell; surface measure on sphere $S_r$. | $\delta(r-v\tau)$ represents a razor-thin spherical shell in radial coordinates, while $\delta_{S_r}$ is the surface delta on $S_r$. Normalizations ensure total emission integrates to $q$. |
| $\delta_\eta(\cdot)$ | Mollified (Gaussian) shell with width $\eta > 0$ for smooth dynamics. | A Gaussian mollifier of width $\eta$ that preserves total mass and regularizes forces to be continuous in time; limits are taken in the weak sense as $\eta\to 0$. |
| $H(\tau)$ | Heaviside step; convention $H(0)=0$ (no instantaneous self-kick). | Enforces causality (no advanced effects). With $H(0)=0$ it removes coincident-time self-kicks; in distributions it gates support to $\tau>0$. |
| $\Phi,\ \Phi_\eta$ | Potential and mollified potential from superposed shells. | Potential from superposing all shell contributions; $\Phi_\eta$ smooths the distribution so $\nabla\Phi_\eta$ exists pointwise and can be used to verify energy identities over resolved windows. |
| $U = q'\,\Phi_\eta$ | Potential energy at a point (mollified; weak limit as $\eta\to 0$). | Scalar potential energy for a receiver in a mollified field. With $\mathbf{F}=-\nabla U$, work satisfies $\Delta E_k=-\Delta U$ on intervals that resolve the mollifier. |
| $\mathbf{F} = -\nabla U$ | Force from the potential (pointwise for $\Phi_\eta$). | Equivalent to the per-hit law after integrating across a thin shell. Exact pointwise equality holds for $\Phi_\eta$; for $\eta\to 0$ it is interpreted in the distributional/integrated sense. |
| $a_{o'\leftarrow j}(t; t_0)$ | Per-hit acceleration from source $j$ emitted at $t_0$ (purely radial, $\propto 1/r^2$). | The contribution from a single causal root: purely radial, falling as $1/r^2$. The total acceleration sums these over all $j$ and all $t_0\in\mathcal{C}_j(t)$. |
| $v_r,\, v_\perp$ | Radial and transverse components of receiver velocity relative to $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$. | Decompose $\mathbf{v}$ by orthogonal projection onto $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$. Only $v_r$ changes instantaneously at a hit; instantaneous power is $\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{v}$ equal to the magnitude of $\mathbf{a}$ times $v_r$. |
| $d_0,\, t_0$ (emergent) | Minimal binary radius and characteristic fastest period from dynamics. | Emergent scales set by balance of delayed attraction and self-repulsion. They depend on $\kappa\,\epsilon^2$ and motion details but act as robust attractors in symmetric binaries. |
| $\mathrm{SS}_a(t)$ | “Sphere stream” of worldline $a$ at observation time $t$ (union of all causal spheres). | The family of all causal spheres emitted along a worldline, evaluated at time $t$; a geometric picture of which shells can currently act at each point. |
| $\Delta$ | Euclidean Laplacian on $\Sigma_t$ ($\Delta = \partial_x^2 + \partial_y^2 + \partial_z^2$). | The standard Euclidean Laplacian acting on functions on $\Sigma_t$; it appears in continuum limits and energetics checks for mollified fields. |
| $\nabla$ | Nabla operator (gradient/divergence/curl). | Vector differential operator used to define $\nabla f$, $\nabla\cdot \mathbf{F}$, and $\nabla\times \mathbf{F}$. We avoid $\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}$ constructs in the canonical law. |
| $\nabla f$ | Gradient of scalar $f$. | Vector field of partial derivatives; points in direction of steepest increase; used for spatial derivatives on $\Sigma_t$. |
| $\nabla\cdot \mathbf{F}$ | Divergence of vector field $\mathbf{F}$. | Scalar measuring net outflow; Gauss-like flux form; identity: $\nabla\cdot(\nabla\times \mathbf{F}) = 0$. |
| $\nabla\times \mathbf{F}$ | Curl of vector field $\mathbf{F}$. | Vector measuring local rotation; identity: $\nabla\times(\nabla f) = \mathbf{0}$. Canonical law uses no right-hand-rule cross-product forces. |
| $\nabla^2 f$ | Laplacian of $f$ (alt. notation for $\Delta f$). | Equal to $\partial_x^2 f + \partial_y^2 f + \partial_z^2 f$ in Cartesian frames; we generally write $\Delta f$. |
| $E(3)$ | Euclidean group of spatial symmetries (translations ⋊ rotations). | The spatial isometry group of $h_{ij}$. Statements are frame-invariant under translations and rotations, even though finite field speed singles out a preferred rest frame for dynamics. |
| $c_{\max} \equiv v$ | Maximal signal speed (field speed of shells). | Upper bound on signal propagation; defines the causal sphere radius $r=c_{\max}(t-t_0)$ and replaces lightcones by expanding spheres in this model. |
| EOM | Master Equation of Motion: delayed, purely radial, inverse-square per-hit law. | Shorthand for the canonical, delayed, radial-only equation of motion. It is event-driven at $\eta=0$ and becomes a smooth ODE system under mollification. |
| Mollify / Mollification | Replace distributions by smooth approximations, e.g., $\delta\!\to\!\delta_\eta$ (Gaussian of width $\eta$), to obtain $C^1$ trajectories and well-defined $\nabla\Phi_\eta$. | Replace distributions by smooth kernels (typically Gaussian) to obtain $C^1$ trajectories and well-defined spatial gradients; $\eta$ sets the smoothing scale relative to local geometry. |
| Regularize / Regularization | The process of introducing $\eta>0$ (or similar) to control singularities; interpret $\eta\to 0$ in the weak/integrated sense. | Introduce a small parameter (e.g., $\eta$) to control divergences so forces and energies remain finite; results are interpreted via limits of integrals as the regulator vanishes. |
| Normalize / Normalization | Choose constants (e.g., $1/(4\pi r^2)$) and Jacobians so total emission integrates to the source strength $q$; ensures conserved totals. | Pick prefactors so integrating the shell over space at fixed time returns the source strength $q$; includes the $1/(4\pi r^2)$ surface density and Jacobians from variable changes. |
| Change of variables (delta) | Identity $\delta(r - v\tau) = \dfrac{1}{v}\,\delta\!\big(\tau - r/v\big)$; the $1/v$ factor is a Jacobian from variable substitution. | Use the identity $\delta(g)=\sum \delta(x-x_i)/\lvert g'(x_i)\rvert$ with $g(\tau)=r-v\tau$ to convert between $\tau$ and $r$; the derivative $g'=-v$ yields the $1/v$ factor in time integrals. |
| Non-dimensionalize | Choose $L_0, T_0$ so $v=L_0/T_0=1$; all speeds become dimensionless ratios to $v$. | Pick $L_0, T_0$ with $v=L_0/T_0=1$ so speeds are pure numbers; reduces parameter count and clarifies asymptotic regimes. |
| Degenerate / Non-degenerate | Degenerate: determinant zero (e.g., metric not invertible); non-degenerate: invertible. We use no non-degenerate 4D metric; spatial metric $h_{ij}$ is non-degenerate. | “Degenerate” refers to non-invertible bilinear forms. The model avoids a non-degenerate 4D metric and instead uses a positive-definite spatial metric $h$ that is invertible. |
| Dot product | Euclidean scalar product: $\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v} = h_{ij}\,u^i v^j$. | The Euclidean inner product; used to compute projections, angles, and kinetic quantities on $\Sigma_t$. |
| Norm | Length from $h_{ij}$: $\lVert \mathbf{v}\rVert = \sqrt{h_{ij} v^i v^j}$. | Induced by the dot product; used for lengths, speeds, and distances, e.g., $r=\lVert\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\rVert$. |
| Coupling | Overall interaction strength set by $\kappa>0$ (absorbs geometric normalizations). | Synonym for the interaction scale $\kappa$; changing it rescales accelerations and modifies emergent scales. |
| Intrinsic | Property of an object independent of motion or environment (e.g., intrinsic charge $q=\pm\epsilon$). | Attributes fixed to an object independent of kinematics or environment (e.g., charge sign and magnitude), contrasted with emergent or apparent properties of assemblies. |
| Causal | Respecting propagation delay; emission time $t_0$ must satisfy $r=v(t-t_0)$ to influence “now.” | Qualifies constructions that respect finite-speed propagation; only emission times satisfying $r=v(t-t_0)$ contribute to present acceleration. |
| Gaussian | The mollifier kernel $\delta_\eta$ used to replace $\delta$, producing smooth shells of width $\eta>0$. | A normalized bell-shaped kernel used as an approximate identity; parameter $\eta$ controls width and convergence as $\eta\to 0$. |
| Heaviside | Step function $H(\tau)$; convention $H(0)=0$ (no instantaneous self-kick). | Step function used to restrict distributions to $\tau\ge 0$; with $H(0)=0$ it removes coincident-time contributions in self-interactions. |
| Hit | A causal intersection event: some $t_0\in\mathcal{C}_j(t)$ where a shell reaches the receiver. | A solution $t_0\in\mathcal{C}_j(t)$. In the impulsive picture it produces a velocity jump; under mollification it appears as a brief, finite push. |
| Surrogate location | Stationary, hypothetical emitter position chosen along the receiver’s current unoriented line of action that, together with an adjusted emission time, reproduces the same instantaneous hit. | An inference/visualization device: at an instant, any hit can be recast to a stationary surrogate on line L; per-wavefront amplitude is unchanged (no emitter-speed weighting), only causal timing shifts. |
| Superposition | Linear addition of fields/accelerations from all sources/shells at a point and time. | Linearity at the level of distributions: contributions from all sources add. Near-field terms dominate due to $1/r^2$ and phase cancellations at large $r$. |
| Transverse | Component orthogonal to $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$; e.g., $\mathbf{v}_\perp$ with $\mathbf{v}_\perp\cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}}=0$. | Component orthogonal to $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$; unchanged instantaneously by a single hit but can change over time as $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ rotates with the geometry. |
| Radial | Along the line of action $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ (e.g., $v_r = \mathbf{v}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{r}}$). | Along the line $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$; every per-hit force is collinear with $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ and thus updates the radial component of motion. |
| Worldline | Time-parameterized path $\mathbf{s}(t)$ of a particle in space; history up to $t_{\text{now}}$ is its provenance. | A map $t\mapsto \mathbf{s}(t)$ with absolute continuity; under impulses $\mathbf{v}$ has bounded variation. Spatial arclength equals the time integral of the speed over an interval. |
| Laplacian | Spatial second-derivative operator on $\Sigma_t$; in Cartesian frames $\Delta = \partial_x^2 + \partial_y^2 + \partial_z^2$. | Same operator as $\Delta$; included for terminological clarity when not using the symbol; used in spatial PDE analogies and energy checks. |
| Singularity | Idealized divergence (e.g., $1/r^2$ at $r=0$); handled by mollification/weak limits. | Non-integrable behavior in pointwise expressions (e.g., $1/r^2$ at $r=0$); handled by excluding measure-zero cases and by regularization with $\delta_\eta$. |
| Jacobian | Factor from change of variables; e.g., $\delta(r - v\tau) = \dfrac{1}{v}\,\delta\!\big(\tau - r/v\big)$ has Jacobian $1/v$. | Multiplicative factor from variable changes ensuring measure preservation in integrals (e.g., the $1/v$ from $\tau\leftrightarrow r$ substitutions). |

Notes:
- Bold symbols denote vectors; hats denote unit vectors; $\lVert\cdot\rVert$ denotes norms.
- All speeds are nondimensional after choosing $L_0, T_0$ so that $v = L_0/T_0 = 1$.
- Assemblies are dynamical geometries of Architrino transceivers (not point particles). Their effective field/wave behavior is the net superposition of their constituent Architrinos evolving under the equation of motion; any “emission/absorption” attributed to an assembly is shorthand for this superposed dynamics.
- Vocabulary: Use “expanding spherical shells” as the canonical term for emitted structures; “wavefront” may be included once as a parenthetical synonym at first use. Avoid generic “spheres” or “ridges” in technical statements (reserve “ridges” for analogies).
