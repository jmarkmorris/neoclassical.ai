# Visualizing Volumes and Exclusion in the Universe

When chemists talk about the **van der Waals (VdW) volume** of a molecule, they mean the space excluded by its electron cloud — the “hard sphere” a molecule presents to its neighbors. This is estimated from atomic van der Waals radii (Bondi, 1964) and corrected for bond overlaps. For example:

| Molecule    | Formula | VdW Volume (Å³) |
| ----------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Hydrogen    | H₂      | 25              |
| Helium      | He      | 27              |
| Nitrogen    | N₂      | 34              |
| Water       | H₂O     | 55              |

*(1 Å³ = 10⁻²⁴ cm³)*

### How much volume do gas molecules actually occupy in air?

At everyday conditions (≈1 atm, room temperature), air is extremely sparse. A quick estimate using van der Waals volumes shows why:

- Take nitrogen (N₂) as representative with VdW volume ≈ 34 Å³ per molecule. One mole then “hard-core” occupies about 34 × 10⁻²⁴ cm³ × N_A ≈ 20 cm³.
- One mole of an ideal gas occupies ≈ 24,000 cm³ at 298 K and 1 atm.
- Packing fraction ≈ 20 cm³ / 24,000 cm³ ≈ 0.08–0.1%.

Intuition scales:
- Average intermolecular spacing ≈ 3–4 nm.
- Mean free path in air ≈ 60–70 nm.

Conclusion: gas molecules “consume” well under one-tenth of a percent of the available volume; most of the space is empty compared to liquids/solids.

### Number densities in air (molecules per cm³, dry air at 1 atm and 25°C)

Using the ideal gas law, dry air at 1 atm and 298 K contains ≈ 2.46 × 10^19 molecules per cm³. Multiplying by typical volume fractions gives:
- Nitrogen (N₂, 78.084%): ≈ 1.92 × 10^19 per cm³
- Oxygen (O₂, 20.946%): ≈ 5.16 × 10^18 per cm³
- Argon (Ar, 0.934%): ≈ 2.30 × 10^17 per cm³
- Carbon dioxide (CO₂, ~420 ppm): ≈ 1.03 × 10^16 per cm³
- Neon (Ne, 18.2 ppm): ≈ 4.5 × 10^14 per cm³
- Helium (He, 5.24 ppm): ≈ 1.29 × 10^14 per cm³
- Methane (CH₄, ~1.9 ppm): ≈ 4.7 × 10^13 per cm³
- Krypton (Kr, 1.14 ppm): ≈ 2.8 × 10^13 per cm³
- Hydrogen (H₂, 0.55 ppm): ≈ 1.35 × 10^13 per cm³
- Nitrous oxide (N₂O, ~0.336 ppm): ≈ 8.3 × 10^12 per cm³
- Xenon (Xe, 0.087 ppm): ≈ 2.1 × 10^12 per cm³
- Ozone (O₃, variable; e.g., 30 ppb): ≈ 7.4 × 10^11 per cm³

Notes:
- “Dry air” omits water vapor. At 25°C and 50% RH, H₂O is ~1.6% by volume (≈ 3.9 × 10^17 per cm³), reducing the dry-air constituents by the same fraction. At 100% RH (25°C), H₂O is ~3.1% (≈ 7.7 × 10^17 per cm³).
- At STP (0°C, 1 atm), total density ≈ 2.69 × 10^19 per cm³; scale species accordingly.
- Despite these high number densities, the “hard-core” geometric occupancy is only ~0.08–0.1% of the volume (see VdW estimate above): the vast majority of air’s volume is spacetime assemblies compared to molecular gases/liquids/solids.

This gives a **geometric baseline** for how much space a molecule excludes. But in real matter, things are more flexible.

## Levels of Excluded Volume

1. **Geometric VdW Volume (constant)**

   * Fixed by tabulated radii.
   * Methane, for instance, is \~71 Å³ regardless of conditions.

2. **Effective Excluded Volume (variable)**

   * Neighboring molecules can compress, stretch, or reorganize electron density.
   * Hydrogen bonding, solvation shells, or π–π stacking alter the apparent space occupied.

3. **Macroscopic Boundaries (everyday examples)**

   * *Air–water boundary*: photons (visible light) mostly pass through, but molecules from one side can’t enter the other without surface disruption.
   * *Air–skin boundary*: oxygen molecules don’t pass freely — they’re excluded by cellular membranes unless aided by proteins.
   * *Metal–skin boundary*: copper atoms in a wire don’t diffuse into your body, but photons (infrared heat, visible light reflections) cross that boundary easily.

4. **Temperature & Pressure Effects**

   * Raising T: molecules vibrate more, structures loosen, apparent excluded volume rises.
   * Raising P: electron clouds compress slightly, effective excluded volume shrinks.

## Who Can “Slip Between” Excluded Regions?

Think of maximally packed van der Waals volumes as a **molecular fortress**. Ordinary atoms are locked out — but not everything plays by those rules.

* **Ordinary matter (atoms, electrons)**: Blocked. They *are* the walls.
* **Photons**: Sometimes pass, sometimes absorbed.
  * Visible light moves through water and glass, but not metal.
  * X-rays probe deep into flesh but are stopped by bone.
  * Gamma rays cut through meters of concrete.
* **Neutrinos**: Pass almost completely unhindered; light-years of lead would be needed to stop them.
* **Dark matter candidates**: If WIMPs or axions exist, they would also pass through matter as though it weren’t there.
* **Gravitons (hypothetical)**: like photons, but for gravity — unhindered.
* **Spacetime itself**: Not excluded. Matter curves spacetime, but doesn’t block it. (mathematical, non-physical interpretation)

## Background timespace vs implemented medium (theory perspective)

- Background: the mathematical arena in this project is absolute timespace (one global time × Euclidean 3-space). It is fixed, non-dynamical, and does not curve.
- Implemented “spacetime”: the effective medium that carries corridors and supports propagation is realized by coherent Architrino assemblies at scales far smaller than molecules (a spacetime-æther layer in the implementation sense, not a separate field inventory). Their microstructure can modulate effective propagation, boundaries, and coherence without altering the background kinematics.

## Big Picture

* **At the molecular level**: van der Waals volume defines exclusion for atoms and molecules.
* **At the material level**: boundaries (air–water, skin–air, skin–metal) are just large-scale manifestations of those exclusions.
* **At the cosmic level**: photons, neutrinos, dark matter, and gravitational waves sail straight through, almost oblivious to the walls that matter erects.

In other words, the van der Waals volume is a “no-go zone” only for **ordinary fermionic matter**. For most of the universe’s particles and fields, those barriers simply don’t exist.
