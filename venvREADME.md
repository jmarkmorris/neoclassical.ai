this is the directory where the virtual environments (plural) exists.
a virtual environment needs to be activated before installing packages so as not to change system files.

each laptop must have its own virtual environment to prevent stepping on one another.

python3 -m venv .venv_air
source .venv_air/bin/activate

python3 -m venv .venv_pro
source .venv_pro/bin/activate

then install packages in the active venv
python3 -m pip install matplotlib
