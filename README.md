# Neoclassical.ai - The Point Potential Universe

**Nature and the universe emerge from a dynamical geometry of equal and opposite point potentials in Euclidean time and 3D space.**

This repository serves as a reference implementation and exploration hub for **Neoclassical Physics and Quantum Gravity (NPQG)**, also referred to as the **Point Potential Universe**. This framework presents a novel and elegant approach to understanding the emergent assembly that results in nature and the universe.

The core idea is that the classical model of geometrical point charges (circa 1900) was too restrictive. By redefining these as immutable, energetic **point potentials** – the electrino (-) and positrino (+) – moving within a fixed Euclidean background of 3D space and 1D time, we uncover a parsimonious neoclassical assembly architecture.

**Project Goal:** To provide a reference implementation of this fundamental ontology of nature based upon the emergence of assemblies from these simple ingredients.

**Aims:** To create an integrated design for learning, teaching, simulation, and understanding the Point Potential Universe.

## Core Principles of the Point Potential Universe

*   **Foundation:** Nature emerges from fundamental, immutable point potentials: the **electrino** (negative potential) and the **positrino** (positive potential). These exist and move within a fixed, flat **Euclidean R4** background (3D space and 1D linear time). This is distinct from Einstein's dynamic spacetime, but NPQG explains how an *effective* spacetime emerges.
*   **Energy Carriers:** Point potentials are the *only* fundamental carriers of energy, in both electromagnetic potential and kinetic forms.
*   **Mechanics:** Governed by **Neoclassical Mechanics**. This extends classical mechanics by removing any speed limit for point potentials. Point potentials behave classically below the potential emission speed but reveal an unexplored dynamical geometry when traveling at or above this speed.
*   **Action:** The action (force) experienced by a receiving point potential depends on the state (position, velocity) of an emitting point potential at a specific point in the emitter's **path history**, determined by the finite speed of potential propagation. This incorporates history potentials fundamentally.
*   **Potential Emission:** Point potentials emit spherically expanding potential waves. At radius = 0, their emission can be modeled as a Dirac delta function. We often visualize them as blue (-) and red (+) spheres, though they are truly geometric points with zero radius.
*   **Immutability:** Point potentials cannot be created or destroyed. They are fundamental. (See Open Questions below).

## Emergence and Key Concepts

NPQG posits that all observed structures and phenomena emerge from the interactions of these point potentials:

*   **Emergent Assemblies:** Complex structures arise dynamically from the interactions of simple point potentials. Key emergent structures include:
    *   **Point Potential Binaries:** Orbiting pairs of electrinos and positrinos form the basis for many stable structures.
    *   **Noether Cores:** Triply nested hierarchies of point potential binaries form stable, self-tuning cores that are the foundation for standard model particles and spacetime itself.
    *   **Spacetime Aether:** Noether cores form a dynamic background medium (aether) whose properties give rise to the effects described by General Relativity (like gravity and spacetime curvature) and the Higgs mechanism. Spacetime is not fundamental but an emergent structure. Generations include the Graviton, Higgs, and Binary structures.
    *   **Standard Model Particles:** Fermions (quarks, electrons, neutrinos) and Bosons (photons, W/Z, gluons) are specific stable assemblies of point potentials built upon Noether cores.
*   **Unification:** NPQG provides a physical basis for both General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Mechanics (QM), bridging these theories and explaining their observations from a single, underlying reality. It aims to transform the Lambda-CDM model of cosmology (ΛCDM).
*   **Energy Shielding & Superposition:** The superposition of potentials within nested Noether cores leads to significant shielding of the total energy contained within. This shielded energy is proposed as the physical reality behind the concepts of **dark matter** and **dark energy**.
*   **Grand Cycle:** The universe operates in cycles. Point potentials aggregate, form structures, eventually fall into black holes, are processed into high-energy Planck cores, and are re-emitted (e.g., via jets) as high-energy point potentials or spacetime assemblies, restarting the cycle. This reinterprets Big Bang events as possibly localized phenomena related to black hole emissions.

## Critique of Standard Models & Historical Context

*   **Failure of Imagination:** Physics between 1875-1927 explored only a limited model of point charges (mapping |q| = |e|) and incorrectly dismissed point particle approaches. Many more sophisticated point potential systems are possible.
*   **Effective Theories:** GR, QM, and ΛCDM are highly successful *effective theories* that match observations well but lack a fundamental grounding in physical reality. They contain ontological errors and paradoxes arising from incorrect assumptions about the fundamental nature of space, time, and matter. NPQG provides the underlying physical ontology.

This model requires only a few free large-scale empirical parameters for cosmology:
1.  The demographics of point potential polarity (presumed 50/50 electrinos/positrinos).
2.  The average volumetric density of point potentials.
3.  The average volumetric density of the energy carried by those point potentials.

NPQG offers a parsimonious recipe for nature, mapping readily to GR, QM, and ΛCDM while resolving their paradoxes and offering superior explanatory power. All existing physics and cosmology models may require enhancements based on this new ontology.
