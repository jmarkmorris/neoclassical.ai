#### I would like to write a test program so that I can explore various approaches to creating an svg font. I want to explore different em dimensions and compare how different circles appear at different sizes as well. It is a lot combinations. Ideally the test program would make an installable font and also produce visual output showing the font at various sizes. How would you approach this?  

Of course. Creating a programmatic way to generate and test fonts with different parameters is an excellent use case for automation. Here is a high-level approach to building a test program for creating SVG-based fonts.

This approach focuses on using Python with the `fontTools` library, which is the standard for programmatically manipulating font files.

### Proposed Approach

I recommend a four-step approach:
1.  **Define a programmatic representation for your glyphs.**
2.  **Create a core function that converts these glyph definitions into an installable font file (`.ttf`).**
3.  **Build a test harness that iterates through your desired parameters and calls the core function.**
4.  **Generate a visual report (e.g., an HTML file) that displays sample text rendered with each generated font at various sizes.**

### Step-by-Step Plan

#### 1. Project Setup

*   **Dependencies**: You will need the `fontTools` library to build the font files and `numpy` to assist with generating geometric shapes. Install them via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install fonttools numpy
    ```
*   **File Structure**: Create a simple project structure.
    ```
    font-tester/
    ├── generate_fonts.py   # Main script
    └── output/             # Directory for generated .ttf files
    ```

#### 2. Core Font Generation Logic (in `generate_fonts.py`)

This involves creating a function that takes font parameters and glyph data as input and outputs a `.ttf` file.

*   **Glyph Generation**: Instead of using SVG paths, this approach generates glyphs directly from geometric primitives (polygons) using `fontTools`' `TTGlyphPen`. This provides more control and avoids external parsing libraries. Helper functions are used to create shapes like circles by approximating them with polygons.

    ```python
    # Example helper to generate points for a circle's outline
    def arc_poly(cx, cy, r, start_angle, end_angle, num_segments=64):
        theta = np.linspace(start_angle, end_angle, num_segments + 1)
        return [(cx + r * np.cos(angle), cy + r * np.sin(angle)) for angle in theta]

    # Example helper to convert a list of points into a glyph
    def polygon_to_glyph(points, glyph_set):
        pen = TTGlyphPen(glyph_set)
        pen.moveTo(points[0])
        for point in points[1:]:
            pen.lineTo(point)
        pen.closePath()
        return pen.glyph()
    ```

*   **Font Assembly Function**: Create a main function, e.g., `create_font(font_name, units_per_em, glyphs_data, output_path)`. This function will perform the following actions using `fontTools`:
    1.  **Initialize a `TTFont` object**: This is the main container for your font.
    2.  **Set up required font tables**: You'll need to create and configure tables like `head` (metadata), `hhea` (horizontal header), `OS/2` (OS-specific metrics), `name` (font name, family), and `cmap` (character-to-glyph mapping). Set the `unitsPerEm` in the `head` table.
    3.  **Process Glyphs**:
        *   Iterate through your `glyphs_data`, which could be a dictionary mapping characters to shape parameters (e.g., `{'A': {'type': 'circle', 'radius': 100}}`).
        *   For each character, call the appropriate helper function (e.g., `circle_to_glyph`) to generate a `fontTools` `TTGlyph` object.
        *   To create hollow shapes, use two contours with opposite winding directions (e.g., outer contour counter-clockwise, inner contour clockwise).
        *   Set the glyph's metrics, like its advance width.
        *   Add the glyph to the font and map its character code in the `cmap` table.
    4.  **Save the Font**: Call `font.save(output_path)` to write the `.ttf` file.

#### 3. Test Harness

This is the top-level part of your script that defines the combinations you want to test.

*   **Define Parameters**: Create lists or dictionaries of the parameters you want to vary.
    ```python
    UNITS_PER_EM_VALUES = [1000, 2048]
    CIRCLE_RADII = [100, 200, 400] # In font units
    ```
*   **Iteration Loop**: Write a loop that iterates through your parameters. Inside the loop:
    1.  Construct a unique font name for the combination (e.g., `CircleTest-EM2048`).
    2.  Define the glyphs for that font. For example, you could map characters 'A', 'B', 'C' to circles with the different radii you're testing.
    3.  Call your `create_font` function with the generated name, the current `units_per_em`, the glyph definitions, and an output file path.

    ```python
    # Example loop structure
    for em_size in UNITS_PER_EM_VALUES:
        font_name = f"CircleTest-EM{em_size}"
        output_file = f"output/{font_name}.ttf"
        
        glyphs = {}
        # Map 'A', 'B', 'C', etc. to different circle sizes
        for i, radius in enumerate(CIRCLE_RADII):
            char = chr(ord('A') + i)
            glyphs[char] = {
                'type': 'circle',
                'cx': em_size / 2,
                'cy': em_size / 2,
                'radius': radius,
                'width': em_size
            }

        create_font(font_name, em_size, glyphs, output_file)
    ```

This approach systematically generates a set of installable font files. To provide immediate feedback, the script will also produce a visual report.

#### 4. Visual Output Generation

To avoid the manual process of installing each font, the script should also generate a visual report, such as an HTML file, that showcases each font variation.

*   **HTML Report Generation**: Create a function that generates an `index.html` file in the `output/` directory.
*   **CSS `@font-face`**: For each generated `.ttf` file, add a `@font-face` rule to a `<style>` block in the HTML. This allows the browser to load and render the local font files.
*   **Display Samples**: In the HTML body, create sections for each font. Within each section, display sample text (e.g., "ABC") at various font sizes (e.g., 12pt, 24pt, 48pt). This will provide an immediate visual comparison of how `units_per_em` and glyph size affect the final rendered output.

    ```html
    <!-- Example HTML structure for one font -->
    <div class="font-showcase">
        <h2>Font: <span class="font-spec">CircleTest-EM1024</span></h2>
        <p style="font-family: 'CircleTest-EM1024'; font-size: 12pt;">12pt: ABCDEF|<>()</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'CircleTest-EM1024'; font-size: 24pt;">24pt: ABCDEF|<>()</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'CircleTest-EM1024'; font-size: 48pt;">48pt: ABCDEF|<>()</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'CircleTest-EM1024'; font-size: 72pt;">72pt: ABCDEF|<>()</p>
    </div>
    ```

By generating both the fonts and a visual HTML report, you can quickly iterate and assess the impact of different font parameters without leaving your development environment.

### More Characters - Make them consistent with overall font.
