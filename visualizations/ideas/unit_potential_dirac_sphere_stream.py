# this animation will start with the void, which is a separate animation
# and seamlessly merge into an explanation of the unit potential aka architrino and it's characteristics
# it has a [q, t, x, y, z, dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt] at all times t.
# it emits Dirac sphere streams. q/v at radius 0. q/rv at radius r>0.
# show the variety of ways to illustrate each of these concepts. 
# whatever works for you is fine.
# which ones could create more confusion.

# show the concept of path
# show how a sphere stream evolves with various slices through space and time.
# metaphors may help, the smoke from a chimney, etc.
#
# this is related to the point_charges.py animation, and should be all part of a series
