# this will be an animation about how I visualize point charges, their emissions, their paths, the action, you name it. 

# everything about a point charge

# start with the Euclidean void they occupy.  We expect very little from it.

# when I get to point charge emissions, somehow illustrate that it is a constant flowing potential that you can thing of several ways.
# mathematically, it initiates a spherical wave at t, x, y, z on the path with magnitude q/velocity.
# that's it. Nothing special happens at q/@. There is no speed limit. Behaves the same at any velocity |v| > @.
# if you like you can imagine that positive unit potentials are emitters and negative unit potentials are sinks.
# However, beware that it doesn't confuse you.  They always source or sink the same spherical wave with magnitude q/v for v>0.
# Because the unit potential is a Dirac potential, it's magnitude at v=0 is q.
# mentally it may be easier to imagine spewing expanding spheres with one number each r=@t from emission.
# and pos / neg numbers
# and we add them
# probably simpler to think of it that way than to imagine physical flow.
# because we end up with a scalar number as the superposition at each t,x,y,z which we can visualize, 
# even though only intersections with point charges matter

# Action at the intersections
# so now we can calculate the potential gradients around each point. d/dx, d/dy, d/dz.
# and we know the velocity dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt
# So we just need the formula on a plane.  
# Which is like determining the effective radius for a stationary q?  Wow. Good insight.
# still we need to determine the effect of the velocity of the receiver.
# what is the effect of v when going upslope vs. downslope?
# and also what about charge. this must all be symmetric,
# it should be easier for an electrino to move towards a positrino than to move away
# it should be harder to move towards a like charge and easier to move away.
# what if we think of forces and work, like a skier on a hill?
# A skier going downhill will be going faster...
# do point charges receive or consume potential when action takes place? If they do it would also be q/v for balance.
# so there are two distinct polarities of potential, but what about potential energy? 
# Can it or should it be accounted for differently for electrinos and positrinos?
# Does uphill or downhill matter? It shouldn't due to symmetry.
# Seems to me like velocity should be a multiplier when it comes to action. That mirrors being a divisor on emission.
# f = k q1 q2 / r^2

# how can I use various graphics to show logarithmic type countours or values?
# a countour map showing scales could work
# which could also be implemented with color of fine grained cells. That might be nice.
# what kind of color scale spans the necessary magnitudes?  from 10^-35 to 10^-3? 32 levels? You would need a very pixalated grid. 
# you would also need a color scale with 32 variations.
