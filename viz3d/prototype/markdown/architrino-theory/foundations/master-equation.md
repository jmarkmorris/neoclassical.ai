## Purpose and Scope

This document presents the **Master Equation of Motion (EOM)** governing the deterministic evolution of all architrinos in the Euclidean void + absolute time substrate. This is the **fundamental dynamical law** of the Architrino Theory, from which all emergent phenomena (particles, fields, spacetime, quantum behavior, gravity) ultimately derive.

The Master EOM is:

- **Deterministic**: Given complete initial conditions at $t_0$, the future is uniquely determined.
- **Non-Markovian**: Depends on full path history, not just instantaneous state.
- **Local in spacetime**: Only intersecting potential shells contribute to acceleration (no action-at-a-distance).
- **Causal**: All influences propagate at finite field speed $c_f$.
- **Self-consistent**: Includes self-interaction (self-hit) when $v > c_f$ at past emission times.

## 1. Overview and Key Principle

### 1.1 The Central Idea

**Fundamental Principle (from Marko's presentation):**

> *Potential at all other points in time and space is irrelevant.*

At time $t$, the acceleration of architrino $i$ at position $\mathbf{x}_i(t)$ depends **only** on potential shells that **intersect its current location**. 

- **Not relevant**: Potential at other spatial locations $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}_i(t)$
- **Not relevant**: Potential at other times $t' \neq t$ (except as encoded in the causal history that arrives "now")
- **Only relevant**: The **intersection events** (causal hits) where $\mathbf{x}_i(t)$ coincides with an expanding shell from some source at some past emission time $t_0 < t$

This is a **strictly local (in spacetime) interaction rule**, despite being non-Markovian (depends on path history).

### 1.2 Abstract Form

The Master Equation of Motion (abstract level):

$$
\boxed{
\frac{d^2 \mathbf{x}_i}{dt^2} = \sum_{j \neq i} \mathbf{F}_{ij}(\text{causal history}) + \mathbf{F}_{ii}(\text{self-hit})
}
$$

where:

- $\mathbf{F}_{ij}(\text{causal history})$: Sum of all causal hits from source $j \neq i$ arriving at receiver $i$ at time $t$
- $\mathbf{F}_{ii}(\text{self-hit})$: Sum of all self-hits (architrino $i$ intersecting its own past emissions)

**Key insight:** Both terms have the same functional form (radial $1/r^2$ force law); they differ only in source identity ($j = i$ vs $j \neq i$).

### 1.3 Path History Potential Integral Form

The Master Equation is most naturally understood as a **path history potential law** akin to the Liénard–Wiechert representation in electromagnetism, though strictly Euclidean/Galilean in character. All of the physical content resides in the past worldlines of the sources, and the path history constraint selects the points on those worldlines whose influence reaches the receiver “now.”

Formally,

$$
\frac{d^2 \mathbf{x}_i}{dt^2}
= \sum_j \kappa\,\sigma_{ij}\,|q_i q_j|
\int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d}t_0 \;
\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}(t; t_0)}{r_{ij}^2(t; t_0)}
\delta\!\Big(r_{ij}(t; t_0) - c_f(t - t_0)\Big),
$$

where

- $r_{ij}(t; t_0) = \|\mathbf{x}_i(t) - \mathbf{x}_j(t_0)\|$,
- $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij} = (\mathbf{x}_i(t) - \mathbf{x}_j(t_0))/r_{ij}$,
- $\delta(\cdot)$ enforces the causal constraint $r_{ij} = c_f(t - t_0)$, and
- $\sigma_{ij} = \mathrm{sign}(q_i q_j)$ encodes attraction/repulsion.

The delta collapses the time integral to the causal set $\mathcal{C}_j(t)$ (see Section 2), so the integrand is evaluated at the **path-history time** $t_0$ determined by the causal constraint $r_{ij}(t; t_0) = c_f(t - t_0)$. This is the causal path-history potential law: acceleration at $t$ depends on the $1/r^2$ contributions from each emission selected by the causal history (rather than any future or instantaneous value). The Euclidean analog of the Liénard–Wiechert potential thus emerges as a **path-history integral** whose kernel is purely radial.

Numerical implementations (Sol) discretize this integral by sampling discrete emission times, producing the familiar picture of summing over “spherical shells.” That discrete shell sum is therefore **a numerical approximation** of the continuous path-history integral, not a separate physical mechanism. The underlying physics remains the continuous causal flux of potential.

## 2. Causal Interaction Set (The Geometry of Delay)

### 2.1 Definition of Causal Emission Times

For a receiver at position $\mathbf{x}_i(t)$ (architrino $i$ at time $t$) and a source with worldline $\mathbf{x}_j(t')$, the **causal emission times** $\mathcal{C}_j(t)$ are all past times $t_0 < t$ such that a potential shell emitted by source $j$ at $t_0$ arrives at $\mathbf{x}_i(t)$ at time $t$.

**Causal constraint:**

$$
\|\mathbf{x}_i(t) - \mathbf{x}_j(t_0)\| = c_f(t - t_0),
$$

where $c_f$ is the field speed (set to 1 in natural units).

**Notation:**

$$
\mathcal{C}_j(t) = \Big\{ t_0 < t \;\Big|\; \|\mathbf{x}_i(t) - \mathbf{x}_j(t_0)\| = c_f(t - t_0) \Big\}.
$$

### 2.2 Single-Hit Regime (Unique $t_0$)

In the **sub-field-speed regime** ($|\mathbf{v}_j(t_0)| < c_f$ locally), the causal set $\mathcal{C}_j(t)$ is **generically a singleton**: there is exactly one emission time $t_0$ that satisfies the causal constraint.

**Intuition:** If the source is moving slower than the field speed, its past emissions form a non-overlapping family of concentric (or nearly concentric) isochrons. Any given receiver location lies on exactly one of those causal surfaces.

### 2.3 Multi-Hit Regime (Multiple $t_0$)

In the **super-field-speed regime** ($|\mathbf{v}_j| > c_f$ at some past times), the causal set $\mathcal{C}_j(t)$ can contain **multiple solutions**:

$$
\mathcal{C}_j(t) = \{t_{0,1}, t_{0,2}, \ldots, t_{0,m}\}.
$$

**Intuition:** If the source outruns its own emissions, it can emit multiple shells that later converge and intersect the same receiver location simultaneously (or nearly so, within regularization width $\eta$).

**Example:** In uniform circular motion at $v > c_f$, a receiver can be hit by shells from multiple points on the source's orbit (different "winding numbers" $m$; see `self-hit-dynamics.md`).

### 2.4 Self-Hit (Source = Receiver, $j = i$)

When $j = i$ (source and receiver are the same architrino), the causal set $\mathcal{C}_i(t)$ represents **self-hits**: times when architrino $i$ intersects its own past emissions.

**Self-hit condition:**

$$
\|\mathbf{x}_i(t) - \mathbf{x}_i(t_0)\| = c_f(t - t_0), \quad t_0 < t.
$$

**Critical requirements for self-hit:**

1. **Curvature**: Straight-line motion admits no self-hits (the worldline never intersects its own past light cones).
2. **Super-field-speed history**: At some emission time $t_0$, the architrino must have exceeded $c_f$ (otherwise, it remains inside all past shells and never catches up).

**Key clarification (from Marko):**

- **Self-hits can be plural**: $\mathcal{C}_i(t)$ can contain multiple emission times (e.g., multiple winding numbers in circular motion).
- **Persistent memory**: Once an architrino has exceeded $v > c_f$ in its past, it can **later slow down** to $v < c_f$ and **still receive self-hits** from shells emitted during the super-field-speed phase. The self-hit regime is **not** instantaneously tied to current velocity; it depends on **path history**.

**Implication:** Self-hit is a **non-Markovian memory effect**. The architrino's current acceleration depends on whether it **ever** exceeded $c_f$ in the past and curved, not just on its current state.

### 2.5 Geometric Interpretation

**Visualize the causal constraint as:**

- Receiver at $\mathbf{x}_i(t)$ "now"
- Source worldline $\{\mathbf{x}_j(t') : t' < t\}$ in the past
-- Field-speed light cone: a sphere of radius $c_f(t - t_0)$ centered at $\mathbf{x}_j(t_0)$
-- **Causal emission times**: where this expanding isochron surface **intersects** the receiver's current location

For each $t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_j(t)$, draw a line from $\mathbf{x}_j(t_0)$ to $\mathbf{x}_i(t)$; this is the **line of action** $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}$ for the force.

**[Diagram to be added]**: Visualize causal light cone, source worldline, expanding isochrons, and receiver intersection. Show both single-hit (sub-$c_f$) and multi-hit (super-$c_f$) cases.

## 3. The Master Equation (Canonical Form)

### 3.1 Per-Hit Acceleration

For each causal emission time $t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_j(t)$, define:

**Separation vector and distance:**

$$
\mathbf{r}_{ij}(t; t_0) = \mathbf{x}_i(t) - \mathbf{x}_j(t_0), \quad r_{ij} = \|\mathbf{r}_{ij}\|.
$$

**Unit direction (line of action):**

$$
\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij} = \frac{\mathbf{r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}} = \frac{\mathbf{x}_i(t) - \mathbf{x}_j(t_0)}{\|\mathbf{x}_i(t) - \mathbf{x}_j(t_0)\|}.
$$

**Charge sign factor:**

$$
\sigma_{ij} = \text{sign}(q_i q_j) = \begin{cases}
+1 & \text{like charges (repel)} \\
-1 & \text{unlike charges (attract)}
\end{cases}
$$

**Per-hit acceleration contribution:**

$$
\mathbf{F}_{ij}(t; t_0) = \kappa \, \sigma_{ij} \, \frac{|q_i q_j|}{r_{ij}^2} \, \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij},
$$

where:

- $\kappa$: universal coupling constant (see Parameter Ledger)
- $q_i, q_j$: charges of receiver and source ($\pm e/6$ for electrinos/positrinos)
- $r_{ij}$: distance from emission point to reception point
- $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}$: radial direction from emission to reception

**Note:** The force is **purely radial** (along $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}$). There are no "magnetic" or velocity-cross-product terms in the fundamental law.

**Implication for emergent forces**: All "magnetic" or velocity-dependent forces (e.g., Lorentz force $\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}$) must arise from **delay geometry** and **superposition of radial hits**, not from intrinsic cross-product terms in the fundamental law. This places the entire burden of magnetic-field emergence on the assembly structure and Noether Sea dynamics (see TOC Ch. 20: "Emergence of Gauge Symmetries").

### 3.2 Total Acceleration (Sum Over All Causal Hits)

The total acceleration on architrino $i$ at time $t$ is the **vector sum** over:

1. All sources $j \neq i$ (partner hits)
2. All causal emission times $t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_j(t)$ for each source
3. Self-hits ($j = i$), if any exist

**Master Equation of Motion (Canonical Form):**

$$
\boxed{
\frac{d^2 \mathbf{x}_i}{dt^2} = \sum_{j} \sum_{t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_j(t)} \kappa \, \sigma_{ij} \, \frac{|q_i q_j|}{r_{ij}^2} \, \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}
}
$$

where:

- Outer sum: over all sources $j$ (including $j = i$ for self-hits)
- Inner sum: over all causal emission times $t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_j(t)$
- Each term: radial $1/r^2$ acceleration with sign $\sigma_{ij}$

**Explicit separation of partner and self-hit terms:**

$$
\frac{d^2 \mathbf{x}_i}{dt^2} = \underbrace{\sum_{j \neq i} \sum_{t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_j(t)} \kappa \, \sigma_{ij} \, \frac{|q_i q_j|}{r_{ij}^2} \, \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}}_{\text{Partner hits}} + \underbrace{\sum_{t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_i(t)} \kappa \, \sigma_{ii} \, \frac{|q_i q_i|}{r_{ii}^2} \, \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ii}}_{\text{Self-hits}}.
$$

**Note:** $\sigma_{ii} = +1$ (like charges repel), so self-hits are always **repulsive**.

### 3.3 Conventions and Exclusions

**Heaviside Convention ($H(0) = 0$):**

The emission at $t_0 = t$ (instantaneous self-force) is **excluded**. Formally, this is enforced by writing:

$$
\mathcal{C}_j(t) = \Big\{ t_0 < t \;\Big|\; \|\mathbf{x}_i(t) - \mathbf{x}_j(t_0)\| = c_f(t - t_0) \Big\}.
$$

(Strict inequality $t_0 < t$; no $t_0 = t$ allowed.)

**Physical justification:** The potential shell at the instant of emission ($r = 0$, $\tau = 0$) has not yet expanded; it cannot exert a force on the emitter "now." Under symmetric regularization (mollification), the $r \to 0$ limit yields zero net push.

**No $r = 0$ causal roots beyond $\tau = 0$:**

Because $r = c_f(t - t_0)$, $r = 0$ implies $\tau = t - t_0 = 0$. This case is excluded by $H(0) = 0$. There are no "collision singularities" in the causal set (architrinos can pass through each other; forces are mediated by expanding shells, not by contact).

### 3.4 Superposition Principle

The Master EOM is **linear in sources**:

$$
\mathbf{F}_{\text{total}} = \sum_j \mathbf{F}_j.
$$

Potentials from distinct sources **superpose** without mutual interference. The total potential at any location is the linear sum of all individual contributions.

**Consequence:** The problem of $N$ interacting architrinos reduces to solving $N$ coupled delay differential equations (DDEs), one per architrino, with each depending on the full history of all others.

## 4. Terms and Conventions (Detailed Breakdown)

### 4.1 Direction and Sign

**Direction of $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}$:**

$\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}$ points **from the source's historical position** $\mathbf{x}_j(t_0)$ **to the receiver's current position** $\mathbf{x}_i(t)$.

**Sign of the force:**

- **Like charges** ($\sigma_{ij} = +1$): Force along $+\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}$ (repulsion; pushes receiver away from emission point)
- **Unlike charges** ($\sigma_{ij} = -1$): Force along $-\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}$ (attraction; pulls receiver toward emission point)

**Two-body checks (stationary sources):**

- Electrino + Electrino (like charges): repulsion
- Positrino + Positrino (like charges): repulsion
- Electrino + Positrino (unlike charges): attraction
- All symmetric: if source and receiver swap roles, the force direction reverses (Newton's third law in the instantaneous-interaction limit)

### 4.2 Scaling and Normalization

**The $1/r^2$ factor:**

Reflects the **surface density** of potential on the causal isochron. As that surface grows, the potential spreads over area $4\pi r^2$, so the density at any point scales as $1/r^2$.

**Absorption of geometric constants into $\kappa$:**

All geometric normalization factors (e.g., $1/(4\pi)$ from spherical surface area, $1/c_f$ from $\delta$-function change-of-variables) are absorbed into the coupling constant $\kappa$ by convention. The canonical per-hit law is written with a clean $\kappa |q_i q_j| / r^2$.

**Dimensional analysis:**

$$
[\kappa] = \frac{[\text{Length}]^3}{[\text{Time}]^2 [\text{Charge}]^2}, \quad [\mathbf{F}] = \frac{[\text{Length}]}{[\text{Time}]^2}.
$$

In natural units with $c_f = 1$, $[\text{Length}] = [\text{Time}]$, and $\kappa$ has dimensions of $[\text{Length}]/[\text{Charge}]^2$.

### 4.3 Receiver Kinematics (Radial vs Orthogonal Components)

At a given hit $(t; t_0)$, decompose the receiver's velocity into components parallel and orthogonal to the line of action $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}$:

$$
\mathbf{v}_i(t) = v_r \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij} + \mathbf{v}_\perp,
$$

where:

- $v_r = \mathbf{v}_i(t) \cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}$ (radial component; positive = moving away from emission point)
- $\mathbf{v}_\perp = \mathbf{v}_i(t) - v_r \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}$ (orthogonal component)

**Instantaneous effect of the hit:**

Because $\mathbf{F}_{ij}(t; t_0) \parallel \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}$, its instantaneous effect satisfies:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{v}_\perp\Big|_{\text{hit}} = \mathbf{0}, \quad \frac{d}{dt}v_r\Big|_{\text{hit}} = \mathbf{F}_{ij} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij} = \kappa \, \sigma_{ij} \, \frac{|q_i q_j|}{r_{ij}^2}.
$$

**Plain language:** A hit only changes the along-the-line velocity component right now; sideways motion continues unaffected (at the instant of the hit). Over time, of course, the changing radial motion alters the trajectory and thus the subsequent orthogonal component.

**Lorentz Suppression Requirement (Tier-1 Constraint):** The receiver kinematics described here must **mechanically** produce Lorentz contraction for moving assemblies (see Action 3, `gravity-spacetime/proper-time-derivation.md`). If tri-binaries do not naturally contract along direction of motion when coupled to Noether Sea, this falsifies the model. See also: `adversarial/constraint-ledger.md`, Lorentz leakage bound ($< 10^{-17}$).

### 4.4 Work and Power

The **instantaneous power** (rate of kinetic energy change) from a single hit is:

$$
\frac{dE_k}{dt}\Big|_{\text{hit}} = \mathbf{F}_{ij} \cdot \mathbf{v}_i = \Big(\mathbf{F}_{ij} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}\Big) v_r = \kappa \, \sigma_{ij} \, \frac{|q_i q_j|}{r_{ij}^2} \, v_r.
$$

**Key insight:** There is **no instantaneous work** on the orthogonal component. Power depends only on the radial velocity $v_r$.

**Radial motion and the $1/r^2$ factor (local trend):**

- **Inward motion** ($v_r < 0$, receiver moving toward the emission point): decreases $r_{ij}$ between close successive hits, tending to **increase** subsequent per-hit strengths via $1/r^2$ (all else equal).
- **Outward motion** ($v_r > 0$): increases $r_{ij}$, tending to **decrease** subsequent per-hit strengths.

**Important caveat:** Path-history delay shifts both the causal root $t_0$ and $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}$ over finite intervals, so these are strictly **local** statements about infinitesimal time evolution. The global trajectory depends on the full history of all sources.

### 4.5 Emission Cadence and Per-Wavefront Amplitude

**Critical modeling note:**

- **Emission cadence**: constant rate (independent of source speed)
- **Per-wavefront amplitude**: constant (independent of source speed)

The receiver's velocity $\mathbf{v}_i(t)$ does **not** modulate the force magnitude $|\mathbf{F}_{ij}|$ itself (at a given $r_{ij}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}$). It influences:

1. The **instantaneous power** through $\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{v} = |\mathbf{F}| v_r$.
2. The **subsequent evolution of $r_{ij}$** (and thus future force magnitudes).

**No Doppler-like amplitude modulation:** Unlike some classical wave models, the architrino emission is **isotropic and constant-amplitude**. All velocity-dependence enters through the **geometry of causal intersections** (which shells hit where and when), not through amplitude changes.

---

## 5. Delay Differential Equation (DDE) Formulation

### 5.1 State Vector and Evolution

Define the **state vector** for architrino $i$:

$$
\mathbf{X}_i(t) = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{x}_i(t) \\ \mathbf{v}_i(t) \end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^6.
$$

The Master EOM is a **second-order ODE** in $\mathbf{x}_i$, or equivalently a **first-order system** in $\mathbf{X}_i$:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{X}_i}{dt} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{v}_i(t) \\ \mathbf{a}_i(t) \end{pmatrix},
$$

where:

$$
\mathbf{a}_i(t) = \sum_{j} \sum_{t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_j(t)} \kappa \, \sigma_{ij} \, \frac{|q_i q_j|}{r_{ij}^2} \, \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}.
$$

### 5.2 Causal Functional Form

The acceleration $\mathbf{a}_i(t)$ depends on the **history** of all worldlines $\{\mathbf{X}_j(t') : t' < t\}$ through the implicit causal constraint:

$$
\|\mathbf{x}_i(t) - \mathbf{x}_j(t_0)\| = c_f(t - t_0).
$$

This makes the system a **delay differential equation (DDE)** with **state-dependent delays** (the delay $\tau_j = t - t_0$ is not constant; it depends on the solution itself).

**Functional notation:**

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{X}_i}{dt} = \mathcal{F}\Big[\mathbf{X}_i(t), \{\mathbf{X}_j(\cdot)\}_{j}, t\Big],
$$

where $\mathcal{F}$ is a **causal functional**: it depends on the current state $\mathbf{X}_i(t)$ and the past states $\{\mathbf{X}_j(t') : t' < t\}$ of all architrinos (including $i$ itself for self-hits).

### 5.3 Regularization (Mollified Shells, Finite $\eta$)

The ideal model uses **surface-delta shells**, which yield **impulsive forces** at isolated hit times $t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_j(t)$. One may treat the dynamics as a **measure-driven ODE** in $t$ (with velocity of bounded variation), or **regularize** by replacing the surface delta with a narrow shell of thickness $\eta > 0$:

$$
\delta(r - \tau) \longrightarrow \delta_\eta(r - \tau) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\,\eta} \exp\!\Big(-\frac{(r - \tau)^2}{2\eta^2}\Big),
$$

while preserving total emission $q$.

**Effect:** This produces **continuous-in-time forces** and classical $C^1$ solutions for $\mathbf{x}_i(t)$ given $C^1$ initial data.

**In the super-field-speed regime** ($|\mathbf{v}_a| > c_f$), multiple self-roots can occur; summing over all causal times with an integrable regularization ensures finite total impulse.

**Convergence requirement:** As $\eta \to 0$, numerical solutions must converge to a well-defined limit. See `simulations/convergence-tests.md` for validation protocols.

### 5.4 Well-Posedness (Existence and Uniqueness)

**Theorem (Schematic):**

Given:
- Initial conditions $\{\mathbf{x}_i(t_0), \mathbf{v}_i(t_0)\}$ for all $i$ at some reference time $t_0$
- Initial history $\{\mathbf{x}_i(t) : t < t_0\}$ (for causal lookback; typically set to free evolution or specified trajectories)
- Regularization parameter $\eta > 0$
- Bounded initial speeds $|\mathbf{v}_i(t_0)| < V_{\max}$

Then:
- The system admits a **unique local solution** $\{\mathbf{X}_i(t) : t \in [t_0, t_0 + T]\}$ for some $T > 0$.
- If speeds remain bounded ($|\mathbf{v}_i(t)| < V_{\max}$ for all $t$), the solution extends to all future times.

**Breakdown:** Solutions may become ill-defined if:
- Speeds diverge to infinity (unphysical runaway; typically prevented by self-hit repulsion).
- Causal roots proliferate without bound (numerical intractability; not expected in physical configurations).

**Proof strategy (deferred to rigorous appendix):**

1. Show that $\mathcal{F}$ is Lipschitz continuous in the state variables (for fixed $\eta > 0$).
2. Apply fixed-point theorems for DDEs with state-dependent delays (see Hale & Verduyn Lunel, *Functional Differential Equations*).
3. Verify that self-hit terms (if present) satisfy the same Lipschitz bounds.

## 6. Core Principles (Operational Summary)

### 6.1 Superposition

**Statement:** The potential fields from all sources **superpose linearly**. The net potential at any point is the sum of the individual potentials:

$$
\Phi_{\text{net}}(\mathbf{x}, t) = \sum_{i} \Phi_i(\mathbf{x}, t).
$$

The total acceleration on a particle at any instant is the **vector sum** of the contributions from every causal entry in its path history.

**Operational implication:** Every architrino is continuously immersed in the superposed wakes of all others (and, when kinematics permit, its own). Tractability comes from treating each causal emission independently with $1/r^2$ distance weighting, which makes **local sources dominate** (distant contributions dilute over large causal surfaces and largely cancel).

### 6.2 Velocity Dependence

**Statement:** The dynamics are **delayed-only** and **purely radial**. Architrinos are transceivers: they emit causal isochrons at a **constant cadence** and **constant per-wavefront amplitude** (independent of emitter speed). The receiver's speed does not change the instantaneous force magnitude; it affects only the **work rate** via $\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{v} = |\mathbf{F}| v_r$.

**Self-interaction requirement:** Self-hit requires $|\mathbf{v}_a| > c_f$ at some emission times (super-field-speed), so the worldline outruns its recent shells. Curvature alone is insufficient if $|\mathbf{v}_a| < c_f$ everywhere (a curved sub-field-speed trajectory never intersects its own past light cones).

**Persistent memory (from Marko's clarification):** Once an architrino has exceeded $v > c_f$ in its past and emitted shells, it can **later slow down** to $v < c_f$ and **still receive self-hits** from those earlier emissions. The self-hit regime is **not instantaneously tied to current velocity**; it is a **path-history memory effect**.

### 6.3 Causality and Locality

**Causal structure:** Event $A$ at $(t_A, \mathbf{x}_A)$ can influence event $B$ at $(t_B, \mathbf{x}_B)$ only if:

$$
t_B > t_A \quad \text{and} \quad \|\mathbf{x}_B - \mathbf{x}_A\| \leq c_f(t_B - t_A).
$$

This defines a **field-speed light cone** (or "causal cone") centered at each event.

**No action-at-a-distance:** All influences propagate at finite speed $c_f$. There are no instantaneous interactions across spatial separation.

**Locality in spacetime:** The Master EOM is **local in spacetime**: only the potential shells **here and now** (at $\mathbf{x}_i(t)$) contribute to the acceleration. However, it is **non-local in configuration space**: the causal history depends on the **entire past worldline** of all sources.

---

## 7. Self-Interaction (Self-Hit Dynamics)

### 7.1 Self-Hit Condition

An architrino $i$ experiences self-hit at time $t$ if there exists $t_0 < t$ such that:

$$
\|\mathbf{x}_i(t) - \mathbf{x}_i(t_0)\| = c_f(t - t_0).
$$

**Geometric interpretation:** The architrino's current position $\mathbf{x}_i(t)$ lies on the causal isochron emitted from its past position $\mathbf{x}_i(t_0)$.

**Requirements:**

1. **Curvature**: The worldline must curve (straight-line motion admits no self-hits).
2. **Super-field-speed history**: At emission time $t_0$, the speed must have been $|\mathbf{v}_i(t_0)| > c_f$ (otherwise, the architrino never outruns its shells).

### 7.2 Multiple Self-Hits (Plural)

**Key insight (from Marko):** An architrino can experience **multiple self-hits simultaneously** (or within a regularization window $\eta$).

**Mechanism:** In curved motion at super-field-speed, the worldline may intersect **multiple past isochrons** at the same observation time $t$. Each intersection corresponds to a distinct emission time $t_{0,k} \in \mathcal{C}_i(t)$.

**Example:** In uniform circular motion at speed $v > c_f$, an architrino can be hit by shells from multiple points on its own orbit, corresponding to different "winding numbers" $m = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$ (see `self-hit-dynamics.md`, Section on Maximum-Curvature Orbit).

**Sum over all self-hit roots:**

$$
\mathbf{F}_{ii}(\text{self-hit}) = \sum_{t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_i(t)} \kappa \, \sigma_{ii} \, \frac{|q_i q_i|}{r_{ii}^2} \, \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ii},
$$

where $\sigma_{ii} = +1$ (like charges repel), so each self-hit contributes an **outward** (repulsive) force.

### 7.3 Persistent Memory (Self-Hit After Slowing Down)

**Critical clarification (from Marko):**

Self-hit is **not** instantaneously tied to current velocity. An architrino that has **previously** exceeded $v > c_f$ and emitted shells can **later slow down** to $v < c_f$ and **still receive self-hits** from those earlier emissions.

**Scenario:**

1. At time $t_1$: Architrino accelerates to $v > c_f$ and emits shells while in super-field-speed regime.
2. At time $t_2 > t_1$: Architrino slows down to $v < c_f$ (e.g., due to partner attraction or external forces).
3. At time $t_3 > t_2$: The architrino's trajectory curves such that it intersects one of the shells emitted at $t_1$ (when $v > c_f$).

**Result:** Self-hit occurs at $t_3$ even though current velocity $|\mathbf{v}(t_3)| < c_f$.

**Implication:** Self-hit is a **path-history memory effect**. The architrino's current acceleration depends on **whether it ever exceeded $c_f$ in the past and curved**, not just on its instantaneous state.

**Non-Markovian nature:** Knowing $\mathbf{x}_i(t)$ and $\mathbf{v}_i(t)$ is insufficient to determine $\mathbf{a}_i(t)$. You need the **full past worldline** $\{\mathbf{x}_i(t') : t' < t\}$ to identify all causal self-hit times $t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_i(t)$.

### 7.4 Self-Hit as Stabilization Mechanism

**Role in binary formation:** Self-hit provides **repulsive radial force** that opposes the attractive pull of opposite-charge partners. This competition produces:

- **Maximum-curvature orbits**: Stable or quasi-stable configurations at minimum radius $R_{\min}$ (see Section 8.3 and `self-hit-dynamics.md`).
- **Prevention of singularities**: Self-repulsion prevents classical $r \to 0$ collapse.
- **Energy balance**: Self-hit can absorb tangential power, enabling quasi-circular orbits.

**Connection to quantum behavior:** The non-Markovian memory and deterministic-but-complex self-hit dynamics are the **seed** of quantum-like phenomena:

- Pilot-wave guidance (self-interference creates effective "guiding field")
- Discrete stable states (attractors in phase space)
- Measurement uncertainty (informational ambiguity at receiver; see Section 9)

**Next steps (Dyna):** Map the full phase-space attractor landscape for self-hit binaries. Questions: (1) How large is the basin of attraction for maximum-curvature orbit? (2) What initial conditions lead to escape (dissociation)? (3) Are there secondary attractors (e.g., elliptical orbits)? See: `assemblies/stability-conditions.md`.

## 8. Worked Examples (Analytic Baselines)

### 8.1 Stationary Opposite Charges (Radial Fall)

**Setup:**
- Two architrinos: Electrino at $\mathbf{x}_1(t)$, Positrino at $\mathbf{x}_2(t)$
- Initial conditions: Both at rest, separated by distance $d_0$
- No self-hits (speeds remain $< c_f$ if $d_0$ is not too small)

**Symmetry:** By charge symmetry, both fall toward their common center of mass.

**Equations:** Radial coordinate $r(t) = \|\mathbf{x}_2(t) - \mathbf{x}_1(t)\|$ satisfies:

$$
\frac{d^2r}{dt^2} = -\frac{2\kappa \epsilon^2}{r^2},
$$

where the factor of 2 comes from the symmetry (each feels the same magnitude force).

**Solution:** Standard Kepler-like radial fall (see TOC Ch. 8 or `assemblies/binary-dynamics.md` for full derivation).

**Key insight:** Partner attraction dominates; no self-hit (speeds remain sub-field-speed for moderate $d_0$).

### 8.2 Sub-Field-Speed Circular Orbit (Instability)

**Setup:**
- Two opposite charges in symmetric circular orbit at radius $R$, speed $v < c_f$
- No self-hits (sub-field-speed regime)

**Partner contribution:**
- Provides inward radial force (centripetal)
- Also provides **tangential force** (always positive, i.e., in direction of motion)

**Result:** Net tangential power $T > 0$ → continuous acceleration → orbit tightens (spiral inward) → speed increases.

**Conclusion:** No stable circular orbit exists in sub-field-speed regime for isolated opposite-charge binaries.

**Cross-reference:** `self-hit-dynamics.md`, Section on Maximum-Curvature Orbit (detailed analysis with equations for $T_p$, radial balance, etc.)

### 8.3 Maximum-Curvature Orbit (Self-Hit Stabilization)

**Setup:**
- Opposite-charge binary spirals inward (as in 8.2) until speed crosses $v = c_f$
- Self-hits activate → repulsive outward force

**Competition:**
- Partner attraction (inward radial)
- Self-repulsion (outward radial)

**Equilibrium:** At critical speed $v_{\text{eq}} > c_f$ and minimum radius $R_{\min}$:
- Radial forces approximately balance (time-averaged)
- Tangential power oscillates around zero
- Orbit stabilizes at **maximum curvature** (tightest configuration)

**Significance:**
- Defines a **fundamental length scale** (likely Planck-scale: $R_{\min} \sim \ell_P$)
- Prevents classical $r \to 0$ singularities
- Foundation for stable particle assemblies (tri-binaries; see TOC Ch. 11)

**Status:** Stability of maximum-curvature orbit is currently a **hypothesis** (not yet proven). Requires: (1) Dyna to map attractor basins in phase space, (2) Sol to demonstrate convergence to stable orbit in long-time simulations ($> 10^6$ orbits), (3) Red to verify no secular energy drift.

**Failure mode:** If simulations show radial oscillations **diverge** (orbit spirals outward or collapses), maximum-curvature orbit is **not** an attractor; self-hit alone is insufficient for stability.

**Full derivation:** See `self-hit-dynamics.md`, Section on Maximum-Curvature Orbit (includes delay equations, tangential components, radial balance, and stability analysis).

## 9. Informational Ambiguity at the Receiver

### 9.1 Limited Information Per Hit

From the perspective of the receiving architrino, the information carried by an intersecting causal isochron is **limited**. The receiver only knows:

1. The **net strength** of the potential at the point of intersection (through the acceleration magnitude $|\mathbf{F}|$).
2. The **unoriented line of action** through its current position (the line along which the force points).

The receiver does **not** have direct knowledge of:
- The source's identity (which architrino $j$?)
- The source's precise distance $r_{ij}$ (without additional assumptions)
- The source's velocity at emission $\mathbf{v}_j(t_0)$

### 9.2 Ambiguity: Electrino vs Positrino on Opposite Sides

A particularly important ambiguity: the receiver cannot distinguish between:

- A **negative potential** due to an Electrino (charge $-e/6$) on one side of the line of action, and
- A **positive potential** due to a Positrino (charge $+e/6$) on the **opposite side** of the same line,

if the resulting radial acceleration is the same.

**Example:** An acceleration **towards** a point along the line of action could be interpreted as:
- Attraction to a Positrino at that point, **or**
- Repulsion from an Electrino located at the diametrically opposite point on the same line.

### 9.3 Rest-Frame Recast (Useful Inference Device)

Any single hit can be **equivalently described** with a **stationary emitter** ($|\mathbf{v}| = 0$) placed somewhere along the same unoriented line of action, with the emitter's actual speed at emission accounted for by an adjusted emission time and, if desired, a surrogate location along that line.

**Key property:** The per-wavefront amplitude remains constant in this recast; it does not depend on emitter speed.

**Utility:** This recast simplifies some analytic calculations and provides intuition for the receiver's "inference problem" (what source configurations are consistent with a given hit?).

### 9.4 Superposition Complicates Inference

The ambiguity is compounded by **superposition**: The net potential at any instant is the sum of all intersecting expanding spherical shells. A measured potential along a single radial can be the consequence of a **complex confluence of fields** from many different emitters located along that line of action, arriving from both directions.

**Consequence:** The receiver experiences a **deterministic acceleration** (given full microstate knowledge, as known to the Absolute Observer), but has **incomplete local information** about the source configuration.

### 9.5 Connection to Quantum Measurement Uncertainty

This limited, unoriented, and source-ambiguous information at the hit level is a **key ingredient** for the emergence of effective quantum-like behavior and measurement uncertainty from deterministic micro-dynamics:

- **Wavefunction as potential distribution**: The "wavefunction" $\psi$ may be interpreted as a **coarse-grained representation** of the superposed potential field (see TOC Ch. 29).
- **Measurement as interaction**: "Measurement" is simply a complex assembly interaction; the "outcome" is determined by which causal hits occur (see TOC Ch. 30).
- **Uncertainty**: Not fundamental indeterminacy, but **informational ambiguity** from the receiver's limited perspective.

**Open question (High Priority):** Does the informational ambiguity in Section 9.2-9.4, when statistically averaged over many similar configurations, **reproduce the Born rule** ($P \propto |\psi|^2$)? This requires: (1) Ensemble simulations of identically prepared systems, (2) Statistical analysis of hit patterns, (3) Comparison to QM predictions. See Action: "Born Rule Derivation" (TBD).

## 10. Parameter Definitions (From Ledger)

All parameters used in the Master EOM are defined in the **Parameter Ledger** (`foundations/ontology.md`, Section 6; and `adversarial/parameter-ledger.md`). For quick reference:

| **Parameter** | **Symbol** | **Value / Status** | **Dimensional** | **Comment** |
|:--------------|:-----------|:-------------------|:----------------|:------------|
| Field speed | $c_f$ | 1 (natural units) | Length/Time | Set by unit choice; physical value TBD |
| Coupling constant | $\kappa$ | TBD | (Length³/Time²)/(Charge²) | Controls $1/r^2$ force strength |
| Architrino charge unit | $\epsilon$ | $e/6$ | Charge | Fundamental charge magnitude |
| Shell thickness (regularization) | $\eta$ | TBD (numerical) | Length | Mollifies delta singularities |

**Status:**

- $c_f = 1$: **Postulated** (unit-setting convention)
- $\kappa$: **To be derived or fitted** (likely related to Coulomb constant $k_e = 1/(4\pi\epsilon_0)$)
  - **Explanatory target**: Derive from $\epsilon$, $c_f$, and Planck units, or demonstrate independence. If $\kappa$ requires adjustment beyond 2 significant figures to match Coulomb constant, flag as potential fine-tuning (FTQ assessment required).
- $\epsilon = e/6$: **Postulated** (explanatory target: why 1/6?)
- $\eta$: **Numerical parameter**
  - **Physical justification required**: Is $\eta \sim \ell_P$ (Planck length), or $\eta \sim R_{\text{inner}}$ (tri-binary inner radius)? If $\eta$ varies by $> 10\%$ across different physical contexts (binaries vs nuclei vs cosmology), theory lacks naturalness.

**Naturalness assessment:** Track fine-tuning quotient (FTQ) for each parameter; flag if FTQ $> 10$ (see TOC Ch. 54).

## 11. Numerical Implementation Notes

### 11.1 Delay Root-Finding Algorithms

At each time step $t$, the numerical integrator must solve the **implicit causal constraint** for each source $j$:

$$
\|\mathbf{x}_i(t) - \mathbf{x}_j(t_0)\| = c_f(t - t_0), \quad t_0 < t.
$$

**Algorithm (schematic):**

1. For each source $j$, search the history buffer $\{\mathbf{x}_j(t') : t' < t\}$ for all $t_0$ satisfying the constraint.
2. Use **bisection** or **Newton-Raphson** to refine roots to tolerance $\epsilon_{\text{root}}$.
3. If multiple roots exist (multi-hit regime), enumerate all; sum their contributions.
4. If no roots exist (source too far away or not yet causal), skip source $j$ at this time step.

**Efficiency:** Use **history binning** or **spatial hashing** to avoid exhaustive search over all past times.

#### 11.1.1 Spatial Hashing for History Buffers

**Efficiency requirement:** Naïve all-pairs history search scales as $O(N^2 T_{\text{history}})$, intractable for $N > 100$ particles. 

**Required optimization:** Implement spatial hash grid with cell size $\sim c_f \Delta t_{\max}$; only search cells within causal range of receiver. Expected scaling: $O(N \log N)$.

**Implementation notes:**
- Partition spatial domain into cubic cells of side length $\Delta_{\text{cell}} \approx c_f T_{\text{history,max}}$
- At each time step, bin all architrino positions into cells
- For receiver at $\mathbf{x}_i(t)$, only search cells within causal radius $r_{\text{max}} = c_f T_{\text{history}}$
- Update hash grid incrementally (not from scratch each step)

**Cross-reference:** `simulations/run-protocols.md`, Section on "History Buffer Management"

### 11.2 Time-Stepping Schemes for DDEs

The Master EOM is a **state-dependent DDE** (delay depends on the solution itself). Standard ODE integrators (e.g., RK4) must be adapted:

**Recommended methods:**

- **Fixed-point iteration** with predictor-corrector (for implicit delays)
- **Adaptive time-stepping** (small $\Delta t$ when roots are close or numerous)
- **Event detection** for exact root crossings (optional; improves accuracy in sharp-hit regime)

**Stability:** Ensure $\Delta t < \eta / c_f$ (resolve mollified shell width); adjust $\eta$ and $\Delta t$ together in convergence tests.

### 11.3 Convergence and Validation

**Convergence tests (required):**

1. **Temporal**: Halve $\Delta t$ → solution converges?
2. **Spatial (regularization)**: Halve $\eta$ → solution converges to $\eta \to 0$ limit?
3. **History buffer depth**: Extend lookback window → no change in recent evolution?

**Validation protocols:**

- **Two-body baselines**: Compare to analytic solutions (radial fall, circular orbits with known parameters).
- **Energy conservation**: Track total energy $E = \sum_i E_{k,i} + U$ (potential energy from summed interactions).
  - **Failure criterion (Tier-2)**: Energy drift **must** be $< 10^{-6}$ per orbit; exceeding this threshold flags simulation instability or unphysical dynamics.
  - **Special attention during $v \to c_f$ transitions** (self-hit activation): if energy spikes $> 10^{-4}$ instantaneously, integrator is unstable.
- **Symmetry preservation**: If initial conditions have symmetry (e.g., reflection, rotation), check that solution respects it.

**Cross-references:**
- `simulations/run-protocols.md`: Detailed numerical standards
- `simulations/convergence-tests.md`: Required test matrix
- TOC Ch. 6: "Numerical Standards and Validation Protocols"

### 11.4 Provenance Tracking (Emission Event → Receiver → Response)

**For debugging and interpretation:**

At each hit, log:
- Source ID $j$
- Emission time $t_0$
- Emission position $\mathbf{x}_j(t_0)$
- Reception time $t$
- Reception position $\mathbf{x}_i(t)$
- Force contribution $\mathbf{F}_{ij}(t; t_0)$

**Use cases:**

- Visualize causal light cones and causal isochrons
- Identify self-hit events and winding numbers
- Trace energy transfer pathways
- Validate superposition (sum of logged forces = total acceleration?)

**Cross-references:**
- `simulations/run-protocols.md`: Metadata and logging requirements
- TOC Ch. 49: "Provenance Tracking and Visualization"

### 11.5 Numerical Parameter Baseline

To ensure reproducibility across all simulation runs, the following **baseline parameter values** are recommended:

| **Parameter** | **Recommended Value** | **Rationale** | **Adjust if...** |
|:--------------|:----------------------|:--------------|:-----------------|
| Time step | $\Delta t < \eta / c_f$ | Resolve mollified shell width | Instability detected (energy spikes) |
| Regularization width | $\eta \in [10^{-3}, 10^{-2}]$ (dimensionless) | Balance between convergence and stability | Convergence test shows $\eta$-dependence |
| Root-finding tolerance | $\epsilon_{\text{root}} = 10^{-12}$ | Machine precision for double floats | Higher precision needed for long-time runs |
| History buffer depth | $T_{\text{history}} \geq 10 / c_f$ | Capture at least 10 field-crossing times | Self-hit requires longer lookback |
| Energy drift tolerance | $\langle \Delta E / E \rangle < 10^{-6}$ per orbit | Tier-2 failure criterion | Higher accuracy needed for stability proofs |

**Notes:**
- All runs must cite these baseline values or explicit deviations with justification.
- Convergence tests (halving $\Delta t$, halving $\eta$) must be performed for any new physical regime.
- Parameter sweeps (varying $\eta$ over $[10^{-4}, 10^{-1}]$) required to verify physical results are not numerical artifacts.

## 13. Summary and Key Takeaways

### 13.1 What This Document Establishes

The **Master Equation of Motion** is the deterministic law governing the evolution of all architrinos:

$$
\frac{d^2 \mathbf{x}_i}{dt^2} = \sum_{j} \sum_{t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_j(t)} \kappa \, \sigma_{ij} \, \frac{|q_i q_j|}{r_{ij}^2} \, \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}.
$$

**Key features:**

1. **Local in spacetime**: Only intersecting potential shells contribute (no action-at-a-distance).
2. **Non-Markovian**: Depends on full path history (self-hit memory).
3. **Superposition**: Linear sum over all sources and causal roots.
4. **Self-hit**: Repulsive self-interaction when $v > c_f$ at past emission times; persists even after slowing down.
5. **Purely radial**: No magnetic or velocity-cross-product terms; all forces along $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}$.

### 13.2 Implications for Emergent Phenomena

**From this single equation:**

- **Stable binaries** form via self-hit stabilization at maximum curvature.
- **Tri-binaries (Noether cores)** emerge as nested binary configurations.
- **Particles** are decorated tri-binary assemblies (see TOC Part IV).
- **Quantum behavior** arises from non-Markovian memory + informational ambiguity.
- **Spacetime curvature** emerges from Noether Sea density gradients (see TOC Part VII).
- **Cosmological expansion** is local energy dissipation in the Noether Sea (see TOC Part VIII).

**The Master EOM is the engine. Everything else is scaffolding.**

### 13.3 Next Steps (Integration with Other Documents)

**Immediate:**
- Populate `self-hit-dynamics.md` with detailed maximum-curvature analysis.
- Implement numerical solvers and validate against analytic baselines (Actions 2-3: Proper Time, Lorentz Suppression).

**Near-term:**
- Map architrino dynamics → assembly formation → particle spectrum (Action 4: Charge Stability Map).
- Derive emergent proper time $d\tau/dt$ from Noether Sea coupling (Action 2).

**Long-term:**
- Full quantum interpretation (TOC Part VI).
- GR phenomenology and cosmology (TOC Parts VII-VIII).
