## 4. Action and Interaction

The dynamics of an Architrino are governed by a simple principle: an **acceleration caused by the intersection of its path with a potential field**. The background is **fixed and non-dynamical** (absolute time × Euclidean space); free paths are straight lines at constant velocity. Accelerations come **only from delayed, purely radial intersections with causal isochrons**—never from background curvature.

For detailed derivations and worked explanations, see 00.2.1 — Exposition (walkthroughs index).

### 4.1 Units and Fundamental Parameters

We choose units with field speed $v_f=1$ (select $L_0,T_0$ so $v_f=L_0/T_0=1$); all speeds are hence dimensionless.

**Fundamental parameters** (ledger):

| Parameter | Symbol | Status | Dimensional | Comment |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Field speed | $v_f=1$ | Postulate | Length/Time | Set by units |
| Elementary charge | $e$ | Postulate | Charge | Electron charge magnitude |
| Architrino charge unit | $\epsilon = e/6$ | Postulate | Charge | Fundamental Architrino charge |
| Coupling constant | $\kappa>0$ | Postulate | (Length$^3$/Time$^2$)/(Charge$^2$) | Controls interaction strength |
**Symbols (local use in this section):**

- $v_f = 1$ (field speed by units),
- $\kappa>0$ (universal coupling),
- $\eta>0$ (computational shell thickness, regularization parameter),
- $\epsilon>0$ (unit charge magnitude); Negatrino $q=-\epsilon$, Positrino $q=+\epsilon$,
- $\sigma_{q q'}=\mathrm{sign}(q\,q')\in\{+1,-1\}$,
- $r=\|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)-\mathbf{s}_o(t_0)\|$,  $\hat{\mathbf{r}}=(\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)-\mathbf{s}_o(t_0))/r$.

### 4.2 Causal Interaction Set

Action occurs when a point object $o'$ at position $\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)$ intersects the potential field $\Phi_o$ generated by a source object $o$ at an earlier emission time $t_0$. This delayed interaction is the sole mechanism of force in the model.

The receiver $o'$ at time $t$ interacts with a source $o$ through the (possibly multi-valued) set of **causal emission times**:
\[
\mathcal{C}_o(t) 
= \Big\{\, t_0 < t \;\Big|\; \|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t_0)\| = v_f(t - t_0) \,\Big\}.
\tag{CT}
\]

- For $|\mathbf{v}_o(t_0)| < v_f$ locally, $\mathcal{C}_o(t)$ is generically a singleton (“unique causal time”).
- For $|\mathbf{v}_o|> v_f$ it may contain multiple solutions (**multi-hit regime**), including self-hits when $o'=o$.

Plain language: this set collects all earlier moments of the source whose causal isochrons currently pass through the receiver’s location; only those emissions can push now.

---

### 4.3 Master Equation of Motion (Canonical Form)

This is the **primary dynamical law**. For each $t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_o(t)$, define
\[
\hat{\mathbf{r}} = \frac{\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t_0)}{\|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t_0)\|}, 
\qquad
r = \|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t_0)\|.
\]

The signed, purely radial contribution from source $o$ at causal time $t_0$ is
\[
\mathbf{a}_{o'\leftarrow o}(t; t_0) 
= \kappa\,\sigma_{q_o q_{o'}}\,\frac{|q_o q_{o'}|}{r^2}\,\hat{\mathbf{r}}.
\tag{EOM}
\]

No magnetic/right-hand-rule terms appear; there are no cross products or explicit velocity-direction couplings—only radial action along $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$. The total acceleration superposes over all sources and causal times:
\[
\boxed{
\displaystyle 
\mathbf{a}_{o'}(t) 
\;=\; 
\sum_{o}\ \sum_{t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_o(t)} 
\kappa\,\sigma_{q_o q_{o'}}\,\frac{|q_o q_{o'}|}{r^2}\,\hat{\mathbf{r}}
}
\tag{MASTER}
\]

**Conventions and exclusions:**

- Geometric normalization factors (e.g., $1/(4\pi)$ and any $1/v_f$ from $\delta$ change-of-variables) are absorbed into $\kappa$; the canonical per-hit law is written with $\kappa\,|q_o q_{o'}|/r^2$.
- **Heaviside convention** $H(0)=0$ (no instantaneous self-force): the emission at $t_0=t$ does not act back on the emitter at the same instant.
- **No $r=0$ causal roots beyond $\tau=0$**: because $r = v_f(t - t_0)$, $r=0$ implies $\tau = t-t_0=0$; that case is excluded by $H(0)=0$. Under mollification, the symmetric limit as $r\to 0$ yields zero net push.

**Two-body checks (stationary sources):**

- Like charges ($\sigma=+1$): repulsion along $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$.
- Unlike charges ($\sigma=-1$): attraction along $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$.
- Stationary source: symmetry implies purely radial action; no tangential component.

Plain language: for each qualifying earlier emission, draw the line from where it was emitted to where the receiver is now, push along that line with a strength set by the charges and a $1/r^2$ falloff, then add up all such pushes.

### 4.4 Receiver Velocity: Radial vs Orthogonal Components

At a given hit $(t; t_0)$, decompose the receiver velocity into components parallel and orthogonal to the line of action $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$:
\[
\mathbf{v}_{o'}(t) \;=\; v_r\,\hat{\mathbf{r}} \;+\; \mathbf{v}_\perp,
\qquad 
v_r \equiv \mathbf{v}_{o'}(t)\cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}},
\qquad 
\mathbf{v}_\perp \equiv \mathbf{v}_{o'}(t) - v_r \hat{\mathbf{r}}.
\]

Because $\mathbf{a}_{o'\leftarrow o}(t;t_0) \parallel \hat{\mathbf{r}}$, its **instantaneous** effect satisfies
\[
\frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{v}_\perp \;=\; \mathbf{0}\quad\text{from this hit}, 
\qquad
\frac{d}{dt}v_r \;=\; \mathbf{a}_{o'\leftarrow o}(t;t_0)\cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}}
\;=\;
\frac{\kappa\,\sigma_{q_o q_{o'}}\,|q_o q_{o'}|}{r^2}.
\]

Thus the per-hit work rate is
\[
\frac{dE_k}{dt}\Big|_{\text{hit}} \;=\; \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{v} 
= (\mathbf{a}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{r}})\,v_r
= \frac{\kappa\,\sigma_{q_o q_{o'}}\,|q_o q_{o'}|}{r^2}\,v_r;
\]
there is no instantaneous work on the orthogonal component.

Radial motion and the $1/r^2$ factor (local trend):

- **Inward motion** ($v_r<0$, receiver moving toward the source history point) decreases $r$ between close successive hits, tending to increase subsequent per-hit strengths via $1/r^2$ (all else equal).
- **Outward motion** ($v_r>0$) increases $r$, tending to decrease subsequent per-hit strengths.

Path-history delay shifts both the causal root $t_0$ and $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ over finite intervals, so these are strictly **local** statements.

Modeling note: Emission cadence and per-wavefront amplitude are constant. The receiver’s velocity does not modulate the force magnitude itself; it influences the instantaneous power through $\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{v} = |\mathbf{a}|\,v_r$ and the subsequent evolution of $r$.

Plain language: split your velocity into along-the-line and sideways. A hit only changes the along-the-line piece right now; sideways motion continues. If you’re moving inward, the next pushes tend to be stronger (1/r²); outward, weaker.

### 4.5 Well-posedness and Regularization

The ideal local model uses surface–delta shells, which yield impulsive forces at isolated hit times. One may treat the dynamics as a **measure-driven ODE** in $t$ (with velocity of bounded variation), or regularize by replacing the surface delta with a narrow shell of thickness $\eta$:
\[
\delta(r - \tau)\ \longrightarrow\ \delta_\eta(r - \tau)
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\,\eta}\,\exp\!\Big(-\frac{(r - \tau)^2}{2\eta^2}\Big),
\tag{REG}
\]
while preserving total emission $q$. This produces continuous-in-time forces and classical $C^1$ solutions for $\mathbf{s}(t)$ given $C^1$ initial data.

In the super-field-speed regime ($|\mathbf{v}_a|>v_f$), multiple self-roots can occur; summing over all causal times with an integrable regularization ensures finite total impulse.

Plain English: the ideal model gives instantaneous “kicks”; the $\eta$-thickening turns them into brief, smooth pushes so standard ODE methods apply.

### 4.6 Core Principles

- **Superposition:**  
  The potential fields from all sources superpose linearly. The net potential at any point is the sum of the individual potentials:
  \[
  \Phi_{\text{net}} = \sum_{i} \Phi_i.
  \]
  The total acceleration on a particle at any instant is the vector sum of the accelerations from all intersecting causal isochrons. Operationally, every Architrino is continuously immersed in the superposed wakes of all others (and, when kinematics permit, its own); tractability comes from treating each causal hit independently with $1/r^2$ distance weighting, which makes local sources dominate.

- **Velocity dependence:**  
  The dynamics are delayed-only and purely radial. Architrinos are transceivers: they emit causal isochrons at a constant cadence and constant per-wavefront amplitude. The receiver’s speed does not change the instantaneous force magnitude; it affects only the work rate via $\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v} = |\mathbf{F}|\,v_r$.  
  Self-interaction (self-hit) requires $|\mathbf{v}_a| > v_f$ at some emission times (super-field-speed), so the worldline outruns its recent isochrons; curvature alone is insufficient if $|\mathbf{v}_a|<v_f$ everywhere.

---

### 4.7 Self-Interaction (Self-Hit)

A crucial dynamic arises from the possibility of **self-interaction**. An Architrino can intersect an expanding spherical shell that it emitted itself at an earlier point in its history.

Self-interaction can occur when an Architrino’s speed has exceeded the field speed ($|\mathbf{v}_a| > v_f$) at some emission times. In this regime, the particle moves ahead of its own past isochrons, allowing it to interact with its own field. The self-hit terms are included in the same Master Equation, via $o'=o$ and $t_0\in \mathcal{C}_o(t)$ with $t_0<t$.

This self-interaction is always **repulsive** for like charge configurations (the Architrino feels its own field as like-on-like) and plays a key role in the stability of emergent structures.

Plain English: like a fast boat catching its own wake after turning, an Architrino can run into its earlier causal isochrons and get a push away from its past positions.

### 4.8 Informational Ambiguity at the Receiver

From the perspective of the receiving Architrino, the information carried by an intersecting causal isochron is limited. The receiver only knows:

1. The **net strength** of the potential at the point of intersection (through the acceleration magnitude).
2. The **unoriented line of action** through its current position (i.e. the line along which the force points); it does not know the orientation along that line from a single hit.

It does **not** have direct knowledge of:
- the source's identity,
- the source's precise distance,
- or the source's velocity at emission.

Consequently, a single received potential can have multiple possible origins. For example, a weak negative potential consistent with a given line of action could be produced by different configurations along that line at various distances.

A particularly important ambiguity: the receiver cannot distinguish between:
- a negative potential due to a Negatrino on one side, and
- a positive potential due to a Positrino on the opposite side,

if the resulting radial acceleration is the same. An acceleration *towards* a point along the line of action could be interpreted as attraction to a Positrino at that point, or as repulsion from a Negatrino located at the diametrically opposite point on the same line.

**Rest-frame recast (useful inference device):** Any single hit can be equivalently described with a stationary emitter ($|\mathbf{v}|=0$) placed somewhere along the same unoriented line of action, with the emitter’s actual speed at emission accounted for by an adjusted emission time and, if desired, a surrogate location along that line. The per-wavefront amplitude remains constant in this recast; it does not depend on emitter speed.

This ambiguity is compounded by **superposition**: the net potential at any instant is the sum of all intersecting expanding spherical shells. A measured potential along a single radial can be the consequence of a complex confluence of fields from many different emitters located along that line of action, arriving from both directions.

This limited, unoriented, and source-ambiguous information at the hit level is a key ingredient in later chapters for the emergence of effective quantum-like behavior and measurement uncertainty from deterministic micro-dynamics.
