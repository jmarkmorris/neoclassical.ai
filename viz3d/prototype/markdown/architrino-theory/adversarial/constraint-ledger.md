# Constraint Ledger

Notes collected here document the falsification criteria, ordering priorities, and supporting mechanisms for the adversarial architrino model. Keep this page focused on observable constraints so we can quickly verify whether a given version of the theory survives experimental scrutiny.

## Tier-1 Hard Walls (Falsification Criteria)

1. **Lorentz Invariance Leakage** – sidereal variations in atomic clocks must remain below $10^{-17}$ or evidence of the Absolute Frame is detectable.
2. **The "Ether Wind" Check** – the Noether Core sea must dynamically enforce the Lorentz contraction of assemblies; otherwise the model is equivalent to an untested preferred frame.
3. **Vacuum Drag** – interactions with the Noether Sea must not induce orbital decay that outpaces GR’s gravitational-wave emission bounds.
4. **GW Speed** – gravitational waves, modeled as density ripples in the Sea, must travel within $|v_{GW}-c|/c < 10^{-15}$ of the local light speed.

## Addenda

### Invisibility of the Absolute Frame
* **Observable** – local Lorentz invariance.
* **Mechanism** – assembly-based clocks/rulers must emerge with proper time $\tau$ rather than absolute time $t$.
* **Failure Condition** – any residual $\delta$ in $L_{moving} = L_{rest} (\gamma^{-1} + \delta)$ that exceeds $10^{-17}$ falsifies the model.

## Master Experimental Constraint Ledger

### 1. Lorentz Invariance & Preferred Frame Effects (Tier 1)
* **Constraint** – isotropy from Michelson–Morley and resonator experiments constrains $|\Delta c/c| < 10^{-17}$ while atomic clock sidereal drift stays below $10^{-16}$.
* **Consolidated Requirement** – prove a Lorentzian conspiracy: architrino assemblies must contract and slow in the Absolute Frame so that no observer can detect the Sea’s rest frame.
* **Failure Condition** – any detectable preferred-frame orientation above $10^{-17}$ invalidates the theory.

### 2. Euclidean vs. Metric Pathing (The Refraction Mapping)
* **Constraint** – Shapiro delay and light bending must match GR to within PPN bounds ($|\gamma - 1| < 10^{-5}$).
* **Architrino Interpretation** – signals traverse straight Euclidean lines; the perceived delay or curvature arises from a refractive-index effect caused by spatial variations in $\rho_{vac}$.
* **Validation Target** – map $g_{00} \approx 1 + 2\Phi/c^2$ onto the refractive slowing experienced by tri-binary signals moving through the absolute grid.

### 3. Gravitational Time Dilation
* **Constraint** – reproduce GPS clock offsets (38 μs/day) and the Pound–Rebka redshift.
* **Mechanism** – mechanical slowing of tri-binary orbital frequencies couples to the local Noether Core density, generating the observed dilation.
