## 1) Photons: Neutral Planar Bundles on a Phase-Locked Corridor (“Photon Train”)

Definition (geometric): A photon is a coherent, charge-neutral, propagating bundle of delayed, purely radial per-hit actions organized along a narrow axial corridor. In practice it appears as a phase-locked stack of planar sub-bundles (“planar bosons on the photon train”) organized by oscillatory constituent architrinos (typically bound in binaries within assemblies). Emission/absorption are re-coupling events among constituent architrinos via internal binaries; no separate gauge-field inventory is required.

- Neutrality and classical character:
  - Net charge is zero at all times; far fields are dominated by transverse oscillations set by path-history geometry. In coherent regimes, photons exhibit classical-beam behavior (“evidence for classical photons”) while retaining packet-like coupling to discrete normal modes.

- Axial corridor geometry:
  - A quasi-cylindrical corridor aligned with propagation axis $\hat{\mathbf{e}}$ carries the superposed $1/r^2$ wake surfaces in a phase structure that self-guides the bundle. The corridor supports a train of phase-aligned planar slices that advance at group speed ~ $v$.

- Polarization, helicity, and Malus:
  - Linear polarization = fixed orientation of the principal transverse oscillation ellipse relative to $\hat{\mathbf{e}}$.
  - Circular/elliptic polarization = constant-phase rotation of that ellipse around $\hat{\mathbf{e}}$; helicity is the sign of this axial phase winding.
  - Malus’s law emerges geometrically: an analyzer projects the corridor’s transverse pattern onto its axis, giving transmitted intensity $\propto \cos^2\theta$ from corridor–analyzer overlap, without invoking right-hand-rule magnetism.

- Kinematics and path:
  - Group velocity ≈ $v$ (1 in our units); no rest frame (apparent rest energy is zero).
  - Energy–frequency correspondence: for a periodic source of angular frequency $\omega$, the apparent energy flux scales $E_{\text{app}} \propto \omega$ over resolved intervals.
  - “Absolute distance and path” correspond to the geometric length of the axial corridor threaded by the train across simultaneity slices $\Sigma_t$.

- Environmental coupling (spacetime æther and media):
  - Refraction, dispersion, and attenuation arise from re-coupling/decoupling between the corridor and coherent ambient assemblies (including spacetime æther assemblies), changing phase velocity or depleting the train.

- Interaction rules (emergent):
  - Coupling is strongest to assemblies with compatible axial corridors (polar regions of binaries/cores).
  - Absorption = corridor re-capture by an internal binary via re-binding of constituent architrinos, increasing mode energy or reconfiguring personality architrinos.
  - Emission = corridor release driven by accelerated constituent architrinos within subassemblies; bursts form short trains, continuous drives form long trains.

Plain language: A photon is a neutral, phase-locked “train” of planar pushes guided down a narrow tube; polarizers simply project that tube’s sideways wiggle (giving cos²$\theta$), and making or absorbing a photon is the tube locking onto or peeling off an internal rotating pair.

## 2) Neutrinos: Strongly Shielded, Net-Neutral Noether-Core Excitations

Definition (geometric): A neutrino is a Noether Core in a net-neutral configuration (no personality charge), with an exterior field that is a tiny, time-averaged residue. Weak interaction strength follows from superposition inside the core that cancels nearly all external projection; only subtle axial mismatches and phase drifts couple to outside structures.

- Core structure and shielding:
  - Triply nested binaries with $q_{\text{net}} = 0$ (no bound personality architrinos). Rapid, orthogonal internal motion cancels far fields (energy shielding), leaving only a faint axial residue—consistent with early-universe neutrino decoupling and vanishing charge.

- Propagation:
  - Trajectories are almost straight at speeds close to v; small deflections occur only through coherent axial corridor couplings to nearby assemblies. Apparent inertia is dictated by the minuscule residual field (“apparent mass” from shielding).

- Flavor and oscillation (internal phase swapping):
  - “Flavor” labels which internal binary predominantly hosts the residual phase imbalance. Slow exchange of this imbalance among the three binaries yields flavor oscillations over distance without invoking a fundamental rest mass; the beat pattern arises from internal phase dynamics and path-history geometry.

- Chirality (handedness bias):
  - Emission/capture selection rules are chiral: axial phase winding favored in typical sources matches observed handedness of weak processes (alignment with W/Z-like corridor re-couplings).

- Weak interactions as corridor re-coupling:
  - Charged-current processes correspond to brief, localized corridor connections that reassign personality architrinos between assemblies (W-like), while neutral-current scattering corresponds to energy/momentum exchange with zero net charge transfer (Z-like). Cross sections are tiny because the neutrino’s exterior field is only a faint residue.

Plain language: A neutrino is a very quiet, neutral core with almost all of its energy hidden; a tiny axial “whisper” shifts among three inner loops as it flies, making its type oscillate, and it interacts only when that whisper lines up just right with another assembly’s axis.
