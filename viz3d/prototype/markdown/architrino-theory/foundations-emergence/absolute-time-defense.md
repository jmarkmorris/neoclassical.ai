### The Case for Absolute Time ($t$)

1. **Fundamental Parameter**: Absolute time $t$ is the unique, universal evolution parameter of the architrino Master Equation. It provides a unique global foliation of the universe.
2. **Virtual Observer Knowledge**: The Virtual (Absolute) Observer indexes the state of all architrinos against $t$, allowing for a single, non-branching history (dissolving Many-Worlds).
3. **Derived Proper Time ($\tau$)**: Proper time is not fundamental; it is a derived functional of the tri-binary clock's motion and its interaction with the local Noether core sea density.
4. **Simultaneity Reclaimed**: In the absolute frame, simultaneity is objective. The "Relativity of Simultaneity" is reinterpreted as a synchronization convention used by assemblies that rely on $c_f$-limited signaling within a moving medium.

### Absolute Time, Global Foliation, and Proper Time

**Absolute time $t$**  
- A single, global, monotonically increasing parameter.
- Defines a unique foliation of the universe into constant‑time hypersurfaces:
  $\Sigma_t = \{(x,y,z,t) \mid (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3\}.$
- The virtual observer indexes the microstate $S(t)$ on each $\Sigma_t$.

This contrasts with:

- **Special Relativity**: simultaneity is frame‑dependent; no global “now.”  
- **General Relativity**: slices are gauge choices; no preferred foliation; time is embedded in a dynamical metric.

In our ontology:

- Absolute time is a **real structure** of the substrate, not a coordinate convention.
- There is one global “now” in which all architrino positions/velocities are defined.

**Proper time $\tau$ for physical observers**  

Physical clocks are tri‑binary assemblies. Their “ticks” are internal dynamical cycles (e.g. orbital frequencies of inner binaries). For a clock following a worldline $\mathbf{X}(t)$, the relation between its proper time $\tau$ and absolute time $t$ is:

$d\tau = F(\text{local medium state at } \mathbf{X}(t), \Phi(\mathbf{X}(t),t), \nabla\Phi(\mathbf{X}(t),t), \mathbf{v}(t))\,dt$

where:
- $\mathbf{v}(t) = d\mathbf{X}/dt$ is velocity in the void frame,
- $\Phi$ and $\nabla\Phi$ encode local potentials/forces,
- the medium state encodes Noether‑core density and stress.

We will require that in the appropriate regimes:

- Homogeneous medium, low velocities:  
  $d\tau/dt \approx \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$ (kinematic time dilation).
- Weak field, low velocities:  
  $d\tau/dt \approx \sqrt{1 + 2\Phi_\text{eff}/c^2 - v^2/c^2}$ (GR‑like redshift).

**Key point:**  
Physical observers experience relativity of simultaneity and time dilation as **emergent properties** of assembly dynamics in the medium. The virtual observer always uses absolute time $t$; proper time $\tau$ is derived.

Any observable signal of absolute time (e.g. orientation‑dependent tick rates absent medium gradients) would falsify the model.

### Absolute Time and Unique Global Foliation

Absolute time $t$ provides a **unique foliation** of the universe into “instants.” The Absolute Observer has access to the full microstate on each slice.

* **AO vs. PO Time**: Absolute time $t$ is the evolution parameter. Proper time $\tau$ (measured by assembly clocks) is a derived functional: $d\tau = F(\text{local medium}, v) dt$.
* **Causal Realism**: The AO sees causation as explicit lawlike mapping from one architrino configuration at time $t$ to one at time $t+\Delta t$.
* **Refutation of Timelessness**: We reject the "Block Universe" where time is a dimension. Time is a process parameter.

### Absolute Time and Unique Global Foliation

* **AO Perspective:** The Absolute Observer at any $(x,y,z)$ sees the exact same absolute time $t$. This creates a unique foliation $\Sigma_t$.
* **Proper Time Distinction:** Absolute time $t$ is the evolution parameter. Proper time $\tau$ is a derived functional measured by assembly clocks: $d\tau = F(\text{medium}, v) dt$.
* **Refuting Kant:** Space/Time are not mental forms; they are the rigid stage of the AO.
* **Refuting Relationalism (Leibniz):** Space is a container (void), not just relations between objects.
