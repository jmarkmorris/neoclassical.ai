I want you to think deeply about the following assertions and comment about reality(what happens), causality, and randomness or chaos or free will.

1. Assertion: The outer binary in a noether core can change energy due to external action in quantized increments (h-bar).  The outcome of a transition can depend on received potentials from external architrinos. Those emitting architrinos may be outside of causal contact. The emitting architrinos may have velocity greater than field speed. Consider this information in your response.
2. Assertion: The middle binary is the symmetry breaking point, often riding along at velocity equal field speed, right on the symmetry breaking point. Any perturbation can send it above or below field speed.  This is different than the outer binary case which tipped between transfer of h or not.  The middle binary is the multiplier in a sense. One side is h. The other side is 2h increments to h inputs. 

This is hypothetical, yet respond as if this is the behaviour so we can explore the implications. 

Now I want you to think deeply about the following assertions and comment about reality(what happens), causality, and randomness or chaos or free will.
