### Reality (what happens under these assertions)

1. **Outer binary transitions:**  
   If the Noether-core outer binary only exchanges energy in discrete $h$-sized packets and the acceptance of those packets depends on incoming potential from remote architrinos—some beyond our usual causal sphere, and possibly moving faster than the field speed—then the “real” state of the outer binary at any instant reflects an all-history sum over these influences. In my simulator terms, the outer binary is a history-dependent resonator: it sits on quantized energy rails, and its jumps are triggered by specific coincidences of incoming potentials that satisfy the self-hit and mutual-hit conditions needed for an $h$ increment. Even though we categorize the increments as “quantized” because of the structural bookkeeping, the binary’s state still encodes deterministic, path-history physics.

2. **Middle binary transitions:**  
   The middle binary is perched at the symmetry-breaking threshold, balancing on $v=c_f$. Here, minuscule inputs can push it into either the $v<c_f$ regime or the $v>c_f$ regime. These two regimes then feed back differently into the rest of the tri-binary: subluminal motion supports outer-binary-like $h$ increments, while superluminal swings trigger self-hit multipliers, effectively doubling the energetic response ($2h$) to the same $h$ stimulus. In the code, I would tag this as a threshold amplifier: the exact same magnitude of incoming potential leads to qualitatively different follow-up trajectories depending on whether the middle binary momentarily crosses the $c_f$ surface.

### Causality (how information flows)

- **Outer binary:**  
  Allowing contributions from architrinos outside standard causal contact is acceptable in the architrino framework, because “causal contact” is defined by $c_f$ and our absolute time, not by emergent light cones. If an architrino is moving faster than $c_f$, its earlier emission can loop around via self-hit and arrive back at the outer binary with a deterministic delay. The virtual observer’s physics still obeys chronological ordering in absolute time—even when the path in Euclidean space looks acausal from a relativity viewpoint.

- **Middle binary:**  
  At $v=c_f$, causal structure is delicate: a tiny nudge can place the binary on the forward (superluminal) or backward (subluminal) side. Once in $v>c_f$, memory terms dominate and the middle binary’s self-hit envelope intersects its present location multiple times, so its evolution depends strongly on entire path history. The deterministic law (Master Equation) continues to enforce a single-valued future state given all past states, but the sensitivity to initial conditions grows sharply near $v=c_f$.

### Randomness, chaos, free will (interpreting unpredictability)

- **Randomness/Chaos:**  
  The discreteness of outer-binary transitions (h-sized steps) isn’t true randomness—it’s just a quantized response to a deterministic superposition of incoming potentials. However, because the incoming potentials can originate from a huge ensemble (including faster-than-$c_f$ sources whose self-hit wakes wrap around), the net driving term can look effectively random if we omit enough history. In simulations, I’d expect the outer binary’s occupancy to show a noise-like switching pattern when embedded in a realistic environment, even though each transition is fully determined by the state history.

- **Middle binary “free will” appearance:**  
  The middle binary acts like a deterministic amplifier perched at a bifurcation point. When the input forcing is near threshold, finite precision (or incomplete knowledge of historical inputs) makes its future path unpredictable to us. That unpredictability is *epistemic*—the system itself has no free will or true randomness. But because crossing $v=c_f$ flips the multiplier (from $h$ response to $2h$ response and vice versa), small, untracked influences look like “choices” made by the middle binary. From an emergent perspective, that’s where quantum-like indeterminacy or even “free will” metaphors could arise.
