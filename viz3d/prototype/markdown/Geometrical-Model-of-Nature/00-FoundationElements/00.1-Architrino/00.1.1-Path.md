## The Architrino Path

### 2.1 Definition and Persistence

As a point particle, an Architrino traces a continuous path (or worldline) through timespace, denoted by its position vector $\mathbf{s}_a(t)$.

**Fundamental Postulate - Eternality**: Architrinos are **eternal**—they cannot be created or destroyed. Each Architrino existed in the infinite past and will exist in the infinite future. This implies that every Architrino has a complete and infinite history.

**Why eternality?** This postulate is motivated by:
- **Simplicity**: Avoids extra mechanisms for genesis/annihilation at the fundamental level.
- **Conservation**: Pairs naturally with charge and energy conservation.
- **Empirical compatibility**: What appears as particle creation/annihilation in experiment is understood as **reconfiguration** of pre-existing Architrino assemblies into new configurations (see later chapters).

**Uniqueness of paths**: The path of each Architrino is unique. No two distinct Architrinos follow the same worldline.

**Continuity**: The worldline of Architrino $a$ is a map $\mathbf{s}_a: (-\infty, t_{\text{now}}] \to \mathbb{R}^3$, assumed at least absolutely continuous in $t$, so the velocity $\mathbf{v}_a(t) = d\mathbf{s}_a/dt$ exists almost everywhere and is piecewise continuous.

### 2.2 Energy Carriers

Architrinos are the **sole carriers of kinetic and potential energy** in this model. All energy is fundamentally tied to the motion and interactions of these point particles. There is no energy associated with the vacuum, curvature, or any substrate independent of Architrino configuration and dynamics.

### 2.3 Coincidence of Particles

As point particles, Architrinos have no physical volume. There is **nothing in the model to prevent two or more particles from occupying the same location at the same instant in time**. For example, an Electrino and Positrino released from rest with some initial separation will accelerate towards each other and can coincide.

**Regularization**: While the model allows coincidence in the idealized limit ($\eta\to 0$, surface deltas), physical behavior near $r=0$ depends crucially on **regularization** (shell thickness $\eta>0$). When $r < \eta$, the regularized force transitions from $1/r^2$ behavior to a bounded, integrable form. This prevents singularities and produces a well-defined limit $\eta\to 0$ in which integrated quantities (total energy, work) remain finite.

### 2.4 Sphere Stream: The Field Landscape

As an Architrino moves along its path $\mathcal{P}_a$, it continuously emits expanding spherical shells. The collection of all spheres emitted from its past path, as they exist at a single moment in time, is called the **sphere stream**.

**Definition**: At an observation time $t_{obs}$, the sphere stream is the union of all spheres $S_{t_0}$ emitted at each past moment $t_0 \le t_{obs}$:

$$
\mathcal{SS}_a(t_{obs}) = \bigcup_{t_0 \le t_{obs}} \Big\{ \mathbf{s} \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid \|\mathbf{s} - \mathbf{s}_a(t_0)\| = v_f(t_{obs} - t_0) \Big\}
$$

This set represents the complete **locus of points in space where the Architrino's field is currently active** at time $t_{obs}$. On each sphere, the potential has surface density $q/(4\pi r^2)$, inherited from the emission normalization.

**Plain language**: Imagine the Architrino dropping tiny "pings" at every moment of its life; each ping becomes a perfectly spherical ripple that expands at speed $v_f$. The sphere stream at observation time is the collection of all those ripples at their current sizes.

### 2.5 Causal Intersection Times

For a receiver $a$ at time $t$ and a source particle $j$, define the **causal set of emission times**:

$$
\mathcal{C}_j(t) = \big\{\, t_0 < t \;\big|\; \|\mathbf{s}_a(t) - \mathbf{s}_j(t_0)\| = v_f(t - t_0) \,\big\}.
$$

This set collects all emission times from source $j$ whose expanding shells have had exactly the right amount of time to reach the receiver's current location.

**Multiplicity**:
- When $|\mathbf{v}_j(t_0)| < v_f$ near a solution, $\mathcal{C}_j(t)$ is typically a **singleton** (one causal time).
- When $|\mathbf{v}_j| > v_f$, **multiple solutions** can occur (**multi-hit regime**).
- **Self-intersection** corresponds to $j=a$ with $t_0<t$ (the receiver intersects its own past shells).

**Plain language**: You feel a push now from source $j$ only if one of its earlier spherical wavefronts has had exactly enough time to reach you. The equation says: "distance traveled by the sphere equals the time since it was emitted, times $v_f$."

### 2.6 Superposition of Sphere Streams

Sphere streams from different Architrinos pass through each other **without interacting** (they do not scatter or absorb each other). This **non-interference** is what allows the **principle of superposition** to apply when calculating the total acceleration on a particle.

In practice, every Architrino is always "riding" the superposed sphere streams of all other Architrinos—and, when kinematics permit (whenever $|\mathbf{v}|>v_f$ at some emission times), of its own past emissions.

The complexity is manageable by treating each causal intersection separately and weighting by distance: each hit contributes a purely radial push scaled by $1/r^2$, so nearby sources dominate while far ones fade.

### 2.7 Future Path and Deterministic Evolution

The future path (for $t > t_{\text{now}}$) is determined by integrating the equation of motion, using the Architrino's current position $\mathbf{s}_a(t_{\text{now}})$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}_a(t_{\text{now}})$ as initial conditions.

The total acceleration on an Architrino at any instant is the vector sum of the individual accelerations caused by each intersecting potential sphere from all sources. This is the **principle of superposition**:

$$
\mathbf{a}_{a}(t) = \sum_{j} \sum_{t_0\in \mathcal{C}_j(t)} \mathbf{a}_{a,j}(t; t_0),
$$

where $\mathbf{a}_{a,j}(t; t_0)$ is the acceleration induced on Architrino $a$ by the field of source particle $j$ at causal time $t_0$.
