### Key Regime Terms

Three-column map of AAA terminology across the tri-binary regimes.

| Aspect | Self-Hit Regime | Symmetry-Breaking Point | Partner-Only Hit Regime |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Speed regime | $v > c_f$ | $v = c_f$ | $v < c_f$ |
| Regime names | Self-hit regime | Symmetry-breaking point; symmetry-breaking threshold; self-hit onset boundary; field-speed threshold; $v=c_f$ hinge | Partner-only hit; non-self-hit; sub-field-speed |
| Binary tier | Inner Binary | Middle Binary | Outer Binary |
| Energy level | High energy binary | Medium energy binary | Low energy binary |
| AdS/CFT mapping | AdS interior; AdS-like; AdS (gravity side) | Holographic horizon/interface; CFT+ interface; event horizon; Planck-scale alignment condition | CFT (exterior QFT); CFT region; CFT/Noether sea |
| Black hole region | inside a black hole | black hole event horizon | outside a black hole |
| Geometry/dynamics | "spacetime" inflation/deflation | flat; planar/2D | "spacetime" expansion/contraction |
| Tri-binary label | Inner (self-hit) | Middle (interface) | Outer (non-self-hit) |
| Frequency label | $f=4x$ | $f=2x$ | $f=1x$ |
