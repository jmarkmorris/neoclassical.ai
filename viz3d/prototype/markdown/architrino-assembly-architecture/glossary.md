### Definitions

| Term | $\mathrm{GR}/\mathrm{QM}/\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ | AAA |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Absolute Time | No universal time; $\mathrm{GR}$ uses coordinate time and proper time along worldlines. | Global, linear time parameter $t$ used by the virtual observer; universal synchronization. |
| Architrino | Not part of standard $\mathrm{GR}/\mathrm{QM}/\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$; no such fundamental entity. | Point transmitter/receiver of polarized potential (electrino/positrino) with fixed charge magnitude. |
| Effective Metric | Metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ is fundamental in $\mathrm{GR}$, not an emergent medium property. | Emergent refractive geometry from Noether Sea density/stress that reproduces GR-like behavior. |
| Euclidean Void | No fixed Euclidean background; $\mathrm{GR}$ uses dynamical spacetime geometry, $\mathrm{QM}/\mathrm{QFT}$ assumes a background only in specific approximations. | Continuous, unmoving $\mathbb{R}^3$ container. |
| Field Speed ($c_f$) | Speed of light $c$ in vacuum; invariant signal speed in $\mathrm{SR}/\mathrm{GR}$. | Propagation speed of architrino potential wakes relative to the void; reference speed for self-hit threshold. |
| Maximal Curvature Binary (MCB) | No analogue in standard models. | Electrino-positrino pair stabilized at minimum radius via self-hit in $v>c_f$ regime; defines prototype length/time. |
| Noether Core | No such assembly; vacuum is not composed of cores. | Neutral assembly (coupled pro/anti tri-binaries) forming a spacetime medium node. |
| Noether Sea | No physical sea; vacuum is the ground state of fields, not a substance. | Lattice/network of Noether cores filling space; the spacetime medium. |
| Planck Scale (AAA usage) | Scale set by $G,\hbar,c$ (Planck length/time/energy) where quantum gravity is expected. | Event-horizon alignment condition where the middle and outer binaries reach $v=c_f$ and become coplanar/co-linear with the inner binary. |
| Proper Time | Invariant time along a worldline, $d\tau^2=-g_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu$; clock time in $\mathrm{GR}$. | Time measured by physical clocks (tri-binary assemblies) interacting with the Noether Sea; emergent from dynamics. |
| Self-Hit | No self-intercepting field-wake dynamics in standard $\mathrm{GR}/\mathrm{QM}$. | When $v>c_f$, an architrino intercepts its own wake, creating non-Markovian feedback. |
| Spacetime Medium (Noether Core Sea) | No physical medium; spacetime is the metric field and vacuum is not a substance. | Pervasive assembly network giving rise to effective metric/inertia. |
| Tri-Binary | No tri-binary assembly; bound states described by quantum fields and forces. | Three nested binaries (inner, middle, outer) with separated radii/frequencies; building block for particles. |
| Virtual Observer (VO) | Observers are physical systems; no privileged bookkeeping observer in $\mathrm{GR}/\mathrm{QM}$. | Non-physical bookkeeping operator with access to full microstate and history at $x,y,z,t$. |
