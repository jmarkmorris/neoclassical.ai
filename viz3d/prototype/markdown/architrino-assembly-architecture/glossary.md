### Definitions

AAA = Architrino Assembly Architecture.

| Term | $\mathrm{GR}/\mathrm{QM}/\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ | AAA |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tbd | No direct equivalent as a fundamental ontic slice in $\mathrm{GR}/\mathrm{QM}/\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$; practical descriptions are observer/model-dependent. | Complete ontic universe state on simultaneity slice $\Sigma_t$ at global time $t$: $S(t)=\{(\mathbf{x}_i(t),\mathbf{v}_i(t),q_i,\ldots)\}$, together with path-history/provenance bookkeeping (emitter identity, emission time) and self-hit history needed for deterministic evolution. This is simulation ground truth. Not an observer. |
| Absolute Time | No universal time; $\mathrm{GR}$ uses coordinate time and proper time along worldlines. | Global, linear time parameter $t$ indexing each $tbd$ slice; universal synchronization. |
| Absolute Frame / Preferred Frame | No preferred inertial frame; all inertial frames are equivalent in $\mathrm{SR}/\mathrm{GR}$. | The Euclidean-void rest frame defined by isotropy of $c_f$ and absolute time; physically real but operationally hidden. |
| Architrino | Not part of standard $\mathrm{GR}/\mathrm{QM}/\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$; no such fundamental entity. | Point transmitter/receiver of polarized potential (electrino:positrino) with fixed charge magnitude. |
| Binary | Bound two-body system; modeled by forces/fields (e.g., EM or gravity), with no intrinsic delay-isochron mechanics. | Opposite-charge pair (electrino:positrino) forming the base assembly; spirals inward and can stabilize via self-hit. |
| Binary, Maximal Curvature (MCB) | No analogue in standard models. | Electrino:positrino pair stabilized at minimum radius via self-hit in $v>c_f$ regime; defines prototype length/time. |
| Binary, Inner | No specific inner-binary layer; bound systems are not organized into nested binary tiers. | Self-hit (maximal-curvature) binary in the tri-binary core; highest curvature and smallest radius. |
| Binary, Middle | No middle-binary tier in standard models. | Field-speed binary at $v=c_f$ acting as energy-storage fulcrum; radius/frequency variable. |
| Binary, Outer | No outer-binary tier in standard models. | Slowest, largest binary; mediates external coupling and approaches $v=c_f$ near alignment. |
| Binary, Tri | No tri-binary assembly; bound states described by quantum fields and forces. | Three nested binaries (inner, middle, outer) with separated radii/frequencies; building block for particles. |
| Causal Isochron | Retarded-time/light-cone surfaces are mathematical constructs; fields are not defined as isochron surfaces. | Expanding causal surface from a single emission time: $r=c_f(t-t_0)$ with $1/r^2$ surface density; intersections deliver radial hits. |
| Causal Wake | Causal influence propagates along light cones; described by fields/wavefronts. | Union of all causal isochrons emitted by a source; the wake/field landscape guiding interactions. |
| Causal Cone ($c_f$) | Light cones define causal influence at speed $c$. | Causality is defined by finite wake speed $c_f$ in absolute time; cones are built from $r=c_f(t-t_0)$. |
| CFT Region / CFT Space | Conformal field theories are specific QFTs without intrinsic length scales. | Partner-only, sub-field-speed regime ($v<c_f$) associated with exterior/bulk behavior. |
| CFT+ Interface | Not a standard term. | Horizon/interface layer where middle and outer binaries lock at $v=c_f$; surface degrees of freedom at Planck alignment. |
| Effective Metric | Metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ is fundamental in $\mathrm{GR}$, not an emergent medium property. | Emergent refractive geometry from Noether Sea density/stress that reproduces GR-like behavior. |
| Electrino | No fundamental $-e/6$ charge; electron is elementary with charge $-e$. | Negative-polarity architrino with charge $q=-\epsilon$ where $\epsilon=\lvert e\rvert/6$. |
| Euclidean Void | No fixed Euclidean background; $\mathrm{GR}$ uses dynamical spacetime geometry, $\mathrm{QM}/\mathrm{QFT}$ assumes a background only in specific approximations. | Continuous, unmoving $\mathbb{R}^3$ container. |
| Field Speed ($c_f$, AAA reference speed) | Speed of light $c$ in vacuum; invariant signal speed in $\mathrm{SR}/\mathrm{GR}$. | Propagation speed of architrino potential wakes relative to the void; reference speed for self-hit threshold. |
| Field-Speed Threshold | No special threshold at $v=c$ beyond kinematic invariance. | Symmetry-breaking boundary at $v=c_f$ separating partner-only and self-hit regimes. |
| Noether Core | No such assembly; vacuum is not composed of cores. | Neutral assembly (coupled pro/anti tri-binaries) forming a spacetime medium node. |
| Noether Sea | No physical sea; vacuum is the ground state of fields, not a substance. | Lattice/network of Noether cores filling space; the spacetime medium. |
| Noether Sea Density ($\rho_{vac}$) | Vacuum energy density or cosmological-constant density $\rho_\Lambda$; typically treated as constant in $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$. | Local Noether core number density $\rho_{vac}(\mathbf{x},t)$; sets refractive index and clock rates. |
| Partner-Only Hit | No analogue in standard models. | Interaction regime with $v<c_f$ where an architrino only intercepts partner wakes (no self-hit). |
| Planck Scale (AAA usage) | Scale set by $G,\hbar,c$ (Planck length/time/energy) where quantum gravity is expected. | Event-horizon alignment condition where the middle and outer binaries reach $v=c_f$ and become coplanar/co-linear with the inner binary. |
| Event-Horizon Alignment Condition | Event horizon is a null surface in GR. | Planck-scale alignment: middle and outer binaries reach $v=c_f$ and become coplanar/co-linear with the inner binary; precession ceases. |
| Tri-Binary Alignment Plateau | No analogue in standard models. | Locked alignment state reached as total velocity approaches $c_f$; planes align and frequencies lock at integer ratios. |
| Positrino | No fundamental $+e/6$ charge; positron is the electron antiparticle with charge $+e$. | Positive-polarity architrino with charge $q=+\epsilon$ where $\epsilon=\lvert e\rvert/6$. |
| Proper Time | Invariant time along a worldline; for signature $(-,+,+,+)$, $d\tau^2=-g_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu$; clock time in $\mathrm{GR}$. | Time measured by physical clocks (tri-binary assemblies) interacting with the Noether Sea; emergent from dynamics. |
| Self-Hit | No self-intercepting field-wake dynamics in standard $\mathrm{GR}/\mathrm{QM}$. | When $v>c_f$, an architrino intercepts its own wake, creating non-Markovian feedback. |
| Self-Hit Onset Boundary | No analogue in standard models. | Bifurcation surface at which delayed self-interaction first appears, typically at $v=c_f$. |
| Spiral | Orbital spirals arise from radiation reaction, dissipation, or non-conservative forces; not a fundamental mechanism. | Typical binary path in sub-$c_f$ regime: logarithmic-like inward spiral driven by delayed partner hits and positive tangential power. |
| Spacetime Medium (Noether Core Sea) | No physical medium; spacetime is the metric field and vacuum is not a substance. | Pervasive assembly network giving rise to effective metric/inertia. |
| Tri-Binary | No tri-binary assembly; bound states described by quantum fields and forces. | Synonym of Binary, Tri. |
| AdS Interior / AdS-Like Region | Anti-de Sitter space is a specific constant-curvature spacetime in GR/string theory. | Self-hit regime ($v>c_f$) with confining/steep potential behavior; interior/“bulk” dynamics. |
