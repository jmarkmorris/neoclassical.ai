# Kinetic and Potential Energy

In this model, all energy is fundamentally tied to Architrinos and the potential fields they generate. Architrinos are the sole primitive carriers of kinetic energy through their motion and the sole primitive sources of potential energy through their interactions. There is no standalone "field substance" or vacuum energy independent of Architrinos and their assemblies.

All such dynamics unfold on a flat, non-dynamical background (absolute time × Euclidean space). Forces and motion arise from **delayed, purely radial hits from causal isochrons** on this fixed background. We work in units with field speed $v_f=1$.

Crucially, what we call "spacetime" at the effective level is not the bare Euclidean background, but a **dense sea of high-energy tri-binary assemblies**. These tri-binaries are extremely small compared to ordinary Standard Model particles and constitute the medium in which all other assemblies move and interact. The energetic state and configuration of this tri-binary sea controls how energy, inertia, and effective geometry appear at larger scales.

## Kinetic Energy and Momentum of a Single Architrino

An Architrino in motion possesses kinetic energy and momentum.

- **Kinetic Energy $E_k$**
  
  A scalar quantity representing the energy of motion. For a single Architrino $a$ with velocity $\mathbf{v}_a(t)$, we write
  
  $$E_{k,a}(t) = K\big(|\mathbf{v}_a(t)|\big),$$
  
  where $K$ is a strictly convex, monotonically increasing function with $K(0)=0$ and $K'(v)\to\infty$ as effective saturation is reached (if applicable), or growing unboundedly in the primitive limit. Strict convexity ensures a one-to-one mapping between kinetic energy and speed magnitude. Because a free Architrino has no intrinsic speed limit in the micro-model, $E_k$ is, in principle, unbounded as $|\mathbf{v}_a|\to\infty$.

- **Momentum $\mathbf{p}_a$**
  
  The vector counterpart of kinetic energy:
  
  $$\mathbf{p}_a(t) = P\big(|\mathbf{v}_a(t)|\big)\,\hat{\mathbf{v}}_a(t), \quad \hat{\mathbf{v}}_a = \frac{\mathbf{v}_a}{|\mathbf{v}_a|},$$
  
  where $P$ is a speed-dependent magnitude. Its detailed form is not postulated at the Architrino level; it emerges from matching to assembly behavior.

**No fundamental mass:**

In this model, mass is not an intrinsic property. We do **not** assume $E_k = \frac{1}{2}m v^2$ or $\mathbf{p} = m \mathbf{v}$ at the substrate level. Instead:

- Kinetic energy and momentum are **primitive kinematic quantities** of Architrinos.
- "Mass" appears **only at the assembly level** as a derived property of how a large internal energy distribution responds to external forcing in the tri-binary sea.

## Work–Energy Relation and Per-Hit Power

Regardless of the explicit form of $K(v)$, kinetic energy must satisfy the **work–energy theorem** along actual trajectories:

$$\frac{dE_{k,a}}{dt} = \mathbf{F}_a(t)\cdot\mathbf{v}_a(t),$$

where $\mathbf{F}_a$ is the net force from all causal hits, given by the Master Equation of Motion.

From the canonical per-hit law

$$\mathbf{a}_{o'\leftarrow o}(t; t_0) = \kappa\,\sigma_{q_o q_{o'}}\,\frac{|q_o q_{o'}|}{r^2}\,\hat{\mathbf{r}},$$

decompose the receiver's velocity into radial and transverse components:

$$\mathbf{v}_{o'} = v_r \hat{\mathbf{r}} + \mathbf{v}_\perp, \quad v_r=\mathbf{v}_{o'}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{r}}.$$

Because $\mathbf{a}_{o'\leftarrow o}\parallel\hat{\mathbf{r}}$:

- The **instantaneous work rate** from this hit is
  
  $$\frac{dE_k}{dt}\bigg|_{\text{hit}} = \mathbf{a}_{o'\leftarrow o}\cdot\mathbf{v}_{o'} = \frac{\kappa\,\sigma_{q_o q_{o'}}\,|q_o q_{o'}|}{r^2}\,v_r.$$

- A hit only changes the **along-the-line** component of velocity; sideways motion $\mathbf{v}_\perp$ is unchanged instantaneously.

## Potential Energy and Net Potential

Potential energy arises from the interaction of an Architrino with the **net potential field** generated by all Architrinos (including, in some regimes, its own past emissions).

### Net Potential Field

At a point $\mathbf{s}$ and time $t$, the net potential is the **superposition** of contributions from all sources:

$$\Phi_{\text{net}}(\mathbf{s},t) = \sum_o \Phi_o(\mathbf{s},t).$$

Each $\Phi_o$ is built from the expanding causal isochrons emitted by source $o$, using the measure-valued or mollified emission density described in the Architrino section. In the mollified representation with causal-surface width $\eta>0$, $\Phi_{\text{net}}$ is a smooth function of $(\mathbf{s},t)$; in the ideal limit $\eta\to 0$ it becomes measure-valued ("paint on isochrons").

### Potential Energy

For a particle $o'$ with charge $q_{o'}$ at position $\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)$, the potential energy $U_{o'}(t)$ is defined as the work required to assemble the current configuration against the causal path-history field:

$$U_{o'}(t) = q_{o'}\,\Phi_{\text{net}}[\text{history}]\big(\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t),t\big).$$

Unlike electrostatics, $\Phi_{\text{net}}$ is not a function of instantaneous source positions but a functional of their past worldlines intercepted by the backward causal cone of $\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)$. The gradient $\nabla\Phi_{\text{net}}$ is taken with respect to the receiver's spatial coordinates on the fixed background, holding the causal history fixed.

When we work with the mollified field $\Phi_\eta$, we can also write:

$$\mathbf{F}_{o'}(t) = -\nabla_{\mathbf{s}_{o'}}U_{o'}(t) = -q_{o'} \nabla_{\mathbf{s}_{o'}} \Phi_{\text{net}}[\text{history}]\big(\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t),t\big),$$

and this is equivalent to the Master Equation in the quasi-static, resolved-in-time limit.

---

## Energy Conservation and Exchange

The model enforces energy conservation via the continuous exchange of energy between kinetic and potential forms, plus energy stored in propagating wakes.

For a single Architrino:

$$\Delta E_k = \int \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{s} = -\Delta U$$

(when we restrict attention to its interactions with a fixed set of sources). For an **isolated system** of Architrinos and their fields, the total energy is:

$$E_{\text{total}} = \sum_a E_{k,a} + U_{\text{int}} + E_{\text{field}},$$

and is constant in time (in the limit of perfect regularization and no open boundaries).

- $U_{\text{int}}$ collects all pairwise interaction energies.
- $E_{\text{field}}$ accounts for energy carried in the wake structures of the tri-binary sea and any "radiation" from assemblies.

In practice, for finite systems or simulation domains, we verify conservation by monitoring $E_{\text{total}}(t)$ and checking convergence as $\eta$ and $\Delta t$ are reduced.

## Spacetime as a Tri-Binary Sea and Energy Storage

At the fundamental level, space is an empty Euclidean container. **Effective spacetime**, the medium in which Standard Model particles live and propagate, is a **sea of high-energy tri-binary assemblies**:

- These tri-binaries are extremely small compared to ordinary particles (electrons, protons, etc.).
- Each tri-binary is itself a tightly bound Architrino assembly with very high internal kinetic and potential energy.
- As a sea, they form a **dense manifold of coupled assemblies** that fills the Euclidean void. This medium is characterized by a non-zero vacuum expectation value of assembly density and internal stress. It provides the constitutive relations (permittivity, permeability, inertial drag) that deform the primitive Architrino dynamics into effective relativistic kinematics, providing a medium for:
  - Emergent inertia and mass,
  - Emergent light cones and Lorentz-like behavior,
  - Effective gravitational coupling (emergent geometry at large scales).

Energy in this picture is distributed across:

1. **Free Architrinos** (rare at low energies),
2. **Standard Model assemblies** (electrons, nucleons, etc.),
3. The **tri-binary sea** that constitutes the effective spacetime medium.

---

## Assemblies: Internal vs Apparent Energy

For composite systems—Standard Model particles, nuclei, composite bound states—formed from Architrinos and embedded in the tri-binary sea, we distinguish:

- **Total internal energy**: what's stored inside the assembly and in its immediate tri-binary environment,
- **Apparent energy**: what leaks out as a long-range field and governs how the assembly interacts with the outside world.

### Internal Energy of an Assembly

For an assembly $A$ (e.g., tri-binary or higher structure), let $i\in A$ run over its constituent Architrinos. Then:

$$E_{\text{internal}}(A) = \sum_{i\in A} E_{k,i} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\substack{i,j\in A \\ i\neq j}} U_{ij} + E_{\text{coupling to sea}}(A),$$

where:

- $E_{k,i}$ is the kinetic energy of Architrino $i$,
- $U_{ij}$ is mutual potential energy of pair $(i,j)$,
- $E_{\text{coupling to sea}}$ accounts for how the assembly deforms and polarizes the surrounding tri-binary sea (local "spacetime medium").

This internal energy can be **very large**: tri-binaries and more complex assemblies may store Planck-scale or higher internal energy, even when the assembly appears as a low-mass particle externally.

### Apparent Energy and Shielding

The surrounding tri-binary sea, and the arrangement of pro/anti Architrinos inside an assembly, can **shield** internal energy from the external world through:

- **Charge cancellation**: positive and negative Architrinos within the assembly (and in surrounding tri-binaries) emit fields that interfere destructively at larger distances.
- **Sphere-stream structuring**: the geometry of internal orbits and tri-binary polarization patterns generates cancellation of most multipoles at scales $r \gg$ assembly size.

Define a **shielding (leakage) factor** $\zeta(A)\in[0,1]$ for an assembly $A$ as:

$$\zeta(A) \equiv \frac{\text{measured external field amplitude (or effective coupling)}}{\text{naive sum of constituent contributions}},$$

evaluated in a regime where the assembly appears as an effective point source. For a strongly shielded, neutral tri-binary in the tri-binary sea, we expect $\zeta\ll 1$.

The **apparent energy** that influences other assemblies at large distances is then roughly:

$$E_{\text{apparent}}(A) \sim \zeta(A)\,E_{\text{internal}}(A),$$

up to proportionality constants fixed by matching to effective low-energy theory (e.g. mapping to $mc^2$).

---

## Emergent Inertia (Mass) from Shielded Energy

**Inertia** is not fundamental; it is an emergent resistance of an assembly's internal energy configuration—plus its coupling to the tri-binary sea—to changes in bulk motion.

### Operational Definition of Inertial Mass

For an assembly $A$, define its inertial mass $m_{\text{inertial}}(A)$ operationally via:

- Apply a small external field (from a distant test source) that exerts a known net force $\mathbf{F}_{\text{ext}}$ on $A$,
- Measure the resulting acceleration of its center of mass $\mathbf{a}_{\text{cm}}$ in the tri-binary sea,
- Define:

$$m_{\text{inertial}}(A) \equiv \frac{|\mathbf{F}_{\text{ext}}|}{|\mathbf{a}_{\text{cm}}|}.$$

Because the external field couples mainly to the **apparent energy**, not the full internal storm, we expect:

$$m_{\text{inertial}}(A) \propto E_{\text{apparent}}(A) \sim \zeta(A)\,E_{\text{internal}}(A).$$

---

### Spacetime Sea and Effective Relativistic Behavior

The tri-binary spacetime sea adds an additional layer:

- Moving assemblies must drag along or re-arrange their local tri-binary environment.
- The effective resistance to high center-of-mass speed (near the internal tri-binary field speed) increases steeply, producing an emergent "speed of light" scale $c_{\text{eff}}$ at which assemblies effectively saturate.

Thus:

- At low speeds $v\ll c_{\text{eff}}$, we recover $E_k \approx \frac{1}{2}m_{\text{inertial}} v^2$ for assemblies.
- At high speeds approaching $c_{\text{eff}}$, internal coupling to the tri-binary sea and self-hit effects yield a relativistic-like $E_k \sim m_{\text{inertial}}(\gamma-1)$, with $\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-v^2/c_{\text{eff}}^2}$, as an **effective law**.

The details of this emergent relativistic law arise from the combined dynamics of the assembly and the tri-binary sea; they are not postulated but must be confirmed by simulation and matching to known particle kinematics.

---

## Energy and Self-Hit in the Tri-Binary Sea

In the **super-field-speed** regime ($|\mathbf{v}_a|>1$ at some emission times), Architrinos and assemblies can intersect their own past isochrons (self-hit). In the presence of the tri-binary sea:

- Self-hit repulsion acts as an internal **stiffening mechanism** for tri-binaries and more complex assemblies, contributing to their stability.
- Energy that an Architrino (or assembly) emitted into its local medium (tri-binary sea) can be partially re-absorbed through delayed self-interaction. At the bookkeeping level, this is an exchange between internal kinetic energy and "field/medium energy" associated with the local tri-binary configuration.

Globally, energy is conserved: self-hit just routes energy along more complex paths (Architrino → causal isochron → tri-binary medium → back to Architrino/assembly).

---

## Intuition (Plain Language)

A causal hit only changes the along-the-line component of velocity; sideways motion is unaffected in that instant. If you are moving inward, the next pushes tend to be stronger because of the $1/r^2$ factor; if you're moving outward, they weaken.

Inside an assembly there is a huge storm of energy. Outside, you only see a faint ripple whose amplitude is set by how imperfect the internal cancellations and sea shielding are.

Architrinos and their assemblies are where all the energy lives. The tri-binary sea is a dense, high-energy ocean in which a few special assemblies (electrons, quarks, nucleons) are like boats. The boats' mass and inertia are not just in the hull—they live in how the hull is built and how it pulls on the water. Most of the ocean's energy never shows up in long-range fields, because the waves from different directions cancel almost exactly. The tiny leftover ripples are what we call gravity and particle masses.

## Summary and Role in the Larger Theory

- **At the Architrino level:**
  
  Kinetic energy and potential energy are defined via the Master EOM and are conserved globally. There is no fundamental mass; speeds are unbounded in principle.

- **At the assembly level:**
  
  Large internal energies, plus coupling to the tri-binary sea, generate:
  - Effective inertia (mass),
  - Shielded external fields (tiny apparent energy compared to internal),
  - An emergent speed scale $c_{\text{eff}}$ and relativistic-like behavior.

- **For spacetime and gravity:**
  
  The sea of small, high-energy tri-binaries forms the effective medium whose coarse-grained energy density and stress give rise to an emergent metric. The shielding factors and internal energies of both vacuum tri-binaries and "matter" assemblies will determine:
  - The effective Newton constant $G$,
  - The cosmological vacuum energy density,
  - How strongly spacetime curvature responds to different kinds of energy.

## Appendix A: Energy Bookkeeping and Reference Zero (AAA Convention)

AAA uses a **binding-energy convention** that fixes the zero of potential energy at the **inner turning point** of a bound pair (the self-hit / max-curvature radius). This choice is both physical and operational: the system has a **hard inner cutoff** (no further compression), so the deepest accessible state is unique and history-independent.

### 1) Physical Setup and Why a New Zero is Needed

For an attractive two-body system (opposite charges), the inward motion accelerates until it reaches a **minimum radius** $r_{\min}$ where self-hit dynamics and curvature limits prevent further collapse. The motion then rebounds or orbits. Unlike a pure Coulomb potential, this system **does** have a lower bound on radius (and hence on accessible energy states).

Because a lower bound exists, the natural reference is **not** "infinite separation" but the **ground configuration** at $r_{\min}$.

### 2) The Bookkeeping Convention

We adopt a **singular-boundary gauge**: since the self-hit dynamics impose a geometric lower bound $r_{\min}$ (the maximum curvature attractor), we fix the potential gauge at this wall.

$$U(r_{\min}) \equiv 0.$$

In this gauge, $U(r)$ represents the **accumulated work** performed to separate the binary from its ground state to radius $r$. Total energy is thus partitioned into *kinetic* (motion) and *deformation* (separation) components, with "free" particles carrying maximal deformation energy $B_{\max}$.

### 3) Binding Energy and Total Energy

Let $B(r)$ denote the **binding energy** at radius $r$, with

$$B(r_{\min}) = B_{\max}.$$

Define

$$U(r) = B_{\max} - B(r).$$

Then total energy bookkeeping is:

$$E_{\text{total}} = K(r) + U(r), \qquad U(r) \ge 0.$$

At the minimum radius:

$$E_{\text{total}} = K_{\max}, \quad U(r_{\min}) = 0.$$

All available mechanical energy is kinetic at the inner turning point. Moving outward converts kinetic energy into potential energy (the rebound / climb-out phase).

### 4) Effective Potential Language

If an effective potential is used, the centrifugal term and the self-hit barrier both contribute:

$$V_{\text{eff}}(r) = V(r) + \frac{L^2}{2 q_{\text{inertia}} r^2} + V_{\text{self-hit}}(r).$$

Here $q_{\text{inertia}}$ is an **effective inertial scale** (a bookkeeping proxy for mass in the coarse-grained description), not the Architrino charge $q$ used in $U=q\Phi$ above.

The convention above fixes:

$$V_{\text{eff}}(r_{\min}) = 0.$$

This does **not** change dynamics; it sets a physically meaningful reference.

### 4.1) Self-Hit Echo and Discrete Steps (Working Note)

In the current picture, the self-hit region is **not** assumed to change the local force law. The radial slope remains smooth:

$$\frac{dU}{dr} \text{ is continuous, and both spirals start with slope } 1.$$

So the transition between the $v=c_f$ regime and the self-hit regime is a **gentle grafting**, not a kink in the potential. The distinction shows up in **how energy is discretized and routed** between binaries, not in a new macroscopic slope.

Working bookkeeping hypothesis:

- Outer binary registers a single-step transaction ($h$-like unit).
- Middle binary adjusts to conserve total energy.
- Inner binary executes a two-step shift ($2h$-like unit), i.e., two discrete updates rather than one.

This can read as an "amplified" response, but only because the inner binary is **releasing or reconfiguring stored energy** when the self-hit echo is engaged. It is **not** net energy creation; it is a redistribution between internal stores under a smooth $U(r)$.

### 4.2) Tri-Binary as Routing/Locking Circuit (Analogy)

It is useful (as a **bookkeeping analogy**) to think of the tri-binary as a **routing/locking circuit** rather than a simple reservoir. An incoming single-step transaction ($h$-like) couples most strongly to the **outer binary**, the **middle binary** acts as a buffer/fulcrum that maintains overall consistency, and the **inner binary** can respond with a two-step reconfiguration when the self-hit echo is engaged. This makes the response feel like a **gear or ratchet**, but the mechanism is still deterministic energy routing, not creation.

In this language, a discrete input can **lock in** a new tri-binary configuration: a threshold-triggered, history-dependent update that selects one stable branch over another. This is a **collapse-like** event in the phenomenological sense (a sudden, discrete state update), but in AAA it is treated as a **deterministic, microstate-sensitive bifurcation**, not an intrinsically stochastic collapse.

### 4.3) Bookkeeping Table: One $h$ of Angular Momentum (Outer $v < v_f$)

Assumptions for this bookkeeping pass:

- $f$ labels a discrete outer-binary orbital state (frequency index). The three rows are **pre-hit** ($f-1$), **action/transition** ($f_{\psi}$), and **post-redistribution** ($f$). There is **one** step in frequency. The $f_{\psi}$ label is a transient bookkeeping state, not a new frequency index or literal wavefunction.
- The transaction is a single angular-momentum unit, $\Delta L_{\text{out}} = +h$, delivered to the **outer** binary while $v_{\text{out}} < v_f$.
- Energy bookkeeping uses action-angle language: for a small discrete step, $\Delta E \approx \omega\,\Delta L$. This is a **notation choice**, not a claim about the exact micro-law.
- The **inner binary** responds with a two-step reconfiguration ($2h$-like). The **middle binary** adjusts to satisfy conservation of total energy and angular momentum (including any wake/field exchange).

Notation in the table:

- $K_o, U_o$ = outer-binary kinetic and potential energies.
- $K_m, U_m$ = middle-binary kinetic and potential energies.
- $K_i, U_i$ = inner-binary kinetic and potential energies.
- Superscripts $(f-1)$, $(f_{\psi})$, and $(f)$ denote the state index (one-step update).

Per-step increments (explicit, no deltas):

- Outer step energy: $\varepsilon_o \equiv \omega_o h$ with
  $$k_o \equiv \chi_o\,\varepsilon_o,\quad u_o \equiv (1-\chi_o)\,\varepsilon_o,$$
  so $k_o + u_o = \varepsilon_o$.
- Inner step energy: $\varepsilon_i \equiv \omega_i h$ with
  $$k_i \equiv \chi_i\,\varepsilon_i,\quad u_i \equiv (1-\chi_i)\,\varepsilon_i,$$
  so $k_i + u_i = \varepsilon_i$. Because the inner binary takes **two steps**, it adds $2k_i$ and $2u_i$.
- Middle adjustment energy: $\varepsilon_m$ is whatever is needed to close the ledger. Here $\varepsilon_w$ denotes the **wake/field exchange energy** during the step:
  $$\varepsilon_m \equiv \varepsilon_w - 2\varepsilon_i,$$
  and we split it as
  $$k_m \equiv \chi_m\,\varepsilon_m,\quad u_m \equiv (1-\chi_m)\,\varepsilon_m.$$

| State | Outer (o) | Middle (m) | Inner (i) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $f-1$ | $K_o^{f-1}$, $U_o^{f-1}$ | $K_m^{f-1}$, $U_m^{f-1}$ | $K_i^{f-1}$, $U_i^{f-1}$ | Baseline. No pending transaction. |

Constraints to apply across the $f-1 \to f$ transition (bookkeeping level):

- **Angular momentum**: $\Delta L_{\text{out}} + \Delta L_{\text{mid}} + \Delta L_{\text{in}} + \Delta L_{\text{wake}} = +h$. A minimal closure consistent with the working hypothesis is $\Delta L_{\text{out}} = +h$, $\Delta L_{\text{in}} = +2h$, $\Delta L_{\text{mid}} = -2h$ (and $\Delta L_{\text{wake}} \approx 0$), but any redistribution that satisfies the sum is acceptable.
- **Energy**: $(k_o+u_o) + (k_m+u_m) + 2(k_i+u_i) = \varepsilon_o + \varepsilon_w$. This is the explicit version of conservation using the per-step increments defined above.
- **Smooth slope**: $dU/dr$ remains continuous across the graft; the discrete behavior comes from **state updates**, not a kink in $U(r)$.

This table is intentionally explicit: every $h$ transaction is split into a kinetic part ($k$) and a potential part ($u$), and the only remaining freedom is **how** each binary partitions its step (the $\chi$ fractions).

### 5) Comparison to Coulomb and Standard Conventions

In pure Coulomb,

$$V(r) = -\frac{k q^2}{r},$$

so there is no inner bound and no natural finite zero. Classical mechanics therefore chooses $V(\infty)=0$.

In AAA, the hard inner cutoff **creates** a natural zero at $r_{\min}$, which is the lowest accessible state. The bookkeeping therefore switches from "energy relative to infinity" to "energy relative to the ground state."

### 6) Summary Table (Operational Meaning)

| Region | $K$ | $U$ | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $r = r_{\min}$ | max | 0 | Fully bound (ground) |
| $r > r_{\min}$ | $\downarrow$ | $\uparrow$ | Climbing out / rebound |
| escape limit | 0 | $B_{\max}$ | Free (unbound) |

### 7) One-Line Rule

If the model has a hard inner bound, **set the potential zero at that bound** and measure all energies outward from it.

In other words, the same shielding that makes the external field small also makes the assembly respond sluggishly (high inertia) compared to the naive sum of constituent kinetic energies.
