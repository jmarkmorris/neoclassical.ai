# Orbiting Binary Assembly

An orbiting binary is the simplest emergent assembly, consisting of two Architrinos of opposite charge—an Electrino and a Positrino. With charges $-\epsilon$ and $+\epsilon$, the assembly is electrically neutral overall. This system demonstrates the fundamental principles of interaction, including the consequences of delayed potential and the role of the velocity symmetry point. 

### 1. System Definition and Equations of Motion

Let's consider the ideal case of a symmetric orbit in a universe with no other Architrinos.

Let the Electrino be particle 1 and the Positrino be particle 2.
-   **Positions:** $\mathbf{s}_1(t)$ and $\mathbf{s}_2(t)$
-   **Charges:** $q_1 = -\epsilon$ and $q_2 = +\epsilon$

The motion of each particle is determined by the field emitted by the other at a delayed time. The acceleration of the Electrino (particle 1) at time $t$ is caused by the Positrino's (particle 2) field emitted at an emission time $t_0$. This is governed by the interaction condition:
$$
\|\mathbf{s}_1(t) - \mathbf{s}_2(t_0)\| = v(t - t_0)
$$
The acceleration vector for the Electrino is attractive, pointing towards the Positrino's delayed position:
$$
\mathbf{a}_1(t) \propto -\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{21} = - \frac{\mathbf{s}_1(t) - \mathbf{s}_2(t_0)}{\|\mathbf{s}_1(t) - \mathbf{s}_2(t_0)\|}
$$
A symmetric set of equations governs the Positrino's motion based on the Electrino's emissions.

### 2. The Inward Exponential Spiral

In the strictly sub-field-speed regime (no self-interaction, $|\mathbf{v}|\le v$), a stable, circular orbit is impossible. Because the attractive force on each particle points to the *past* position of its partner, it is not a true central force. This delay yields an **inward exponential spiral** that shrinks $r$ and increases speed until the self-interaction threshold ($|\mathbf{v}|>v$) is crossed.

-   The tangential component of the delayed force sustains the orbital motion.
-   The radial component continuously pulls the particles closer together.

With perfectly symmetric initial conditions (e.g., starting at rest), the paths of the Electrino and Positrino are distinct but perfect mirror images of each other. As they spiral inward, their speeds continuously increase. Emission cadence and per-wavefront amplitude remain constant; the evolution is driven entirely by delay geometry and, once active, self-interaction.

### 3. Evolution Through Velocity Regimes

The binary system's evolution is characterized by two distinct phases defined by the velocity symmetry point.

#### **Contraction Phase ($|\mathbf{v}| \le v$)**
Initially, and as long as the speeds of both particles are less than or equal to the field speed $v$, they are only influenced by their partner's attractive field. The total acceleration is simply the attractive force:
$$
\mathbf{a}_{1, \text{total}}(t) = \mathbf{a}_{1,2}(t) \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{a}_{2, \text{total}}(t) = \mathbf{a}_{2,1}(t)
$$
During this phase, the system is purely contractile, with the particles accelerating and spiraling towards each other.

#### **Deflationary Phase ($|\mathbf{v}| > v$)**
Once the particles' speeds exceed the field speed $v$, they cross the symmetry point and begin to interact with their own recently emitted, repulsive wakes. The total acceleration on each particle now becomes a superposition of attraction from its partner and self-repulsion. For the Electrino:
$$
\mathbf{a}_{1, \text{total}}(t) = \mathbf{a}_{1,2}(t) + \mathbf{a}_{1,1}(t)
$$
The new self-repulsive term, $\mathbf{a}_{1,1}(t)$, grows rapidly as the path curvature increases, causing the inward spiral to tighten while driving the system toward a curvature-limited minimum radius rather than a singular collapse. This phase is "deflationary" in that self-interaction accelerates the approach to the limiting circular state.

### 4. The Stable State and Emergent Properties

The deflationary spiral does not continue indefinitely. The self-repulsive force creates a dynamic feedback mechanism that ultimately stabilizes the system and prevents a singularity.

#### **Curvature Limit and Stability**
The inward spiral does not lead to a singularity. The limiting factor is the geometry of self-interaction. As the spiral tightens, the path's curvature increases, bringing each Architrino closer to its own recent emission points. This proximity dramatically amplifies the self-repulsive force. The system reaches a critical state where any further decrease in orbital radius would cause an overwhelming increase in this self-repulsion, effectively creating a "pressure" that resists further collapse. The inward spiral is halted not by a simple balance of forces, but by this geometric feedback loop.

At this limit, the trajectory stabilizes, and the system settles into a **stable, circular orbit of a minimum radius**. This final state is a dynamic equilibrium where the inward pull from the partner is perfectly channeled into the circular motion, while the self-repulsive force prevents any further tightening of the path's curvature. Importantly, this minimum-radius circular state only exists once self-interaction is active ($|\mathbf{v}|>v$); in the strictly sub-field-speed regime ($|\mathbf{v}|\le v$) no stable circular orbit exists.

#### **Emergent Properties**
The stabilization of the orbiting binary gives rise to fundamental, emergent properties for the universe:
-   No intrinsic speed cap at the Architrino level; the assembly imposes an apparent speed bound (group constraints and $d_0$, $t_0$).
-   **An Emergent Unit of Distance:** The radius of this stable orbit is a constant, determined by the fundamental parameters of the model (field speed $v$, charge $\epsilon$). It serves as the smallest possible orbital radius and thus becomes a natural, emergent unit of distance.
-   **An Imposed Speed Limit:** While individual Architrinos have no inherent speed limit, the particles within this stable assembly are constrained to a specific, constant orbital speed. This creates a practical speed limit for particles bound within such structures.
-   **A Zero-Potential Axis:** In an ideal, symmetric orbit, the positive and negative potentials emitted by the two particles perfectly cancel along the axis of rotation. This creates a line of zero net potential. This axis acts as a near-zero-potential corridor through which another Architrino could pass without being accelerated by the binary, provided its path is perfectly aligned with the axis.

Validation note: Compare these claims against the standard numerical cross-checks (see 00.2.5 — Numerical Cross-Checks).

**Note on Complex Scenarios:** The analysis above describes a stationary binary system. More complex dynamics arise when the binary assembly is also translating through space, especially when the axis of orbit is not aligned with the direction of the group's velocity.

# Emergent Measurement of Time and Distance

While the model is founded on the concepts of absolute space and absolute time, these are featureless, continuous arenas. They provide the mathematical background for geometry and motion but contain no inherent "ruler" or "clock." There are no fundamental, pre-defined units of distance or time. Instead, these units must emerge from the dynamics of the system itself.

### The Stable Binary as a Universal Standard

The necessary physical standard for measurement arises from the most fundamental assembly: the **stable orbiting binary**. As described previously, an isolated Electrino-Positrino pair does not collapse into a singularity. Instead, due to the interplay between delayed attraction and self-repulsive feedback, it settles into a stable, circular orbit characterized by:
-   A **minimum possible radius**.
-   A **maximum possible orbital frequency** (and thus a minimum period).

This stable state is a universal attractor for a binary system, and its properties are determined solely by the fundamental constants of the model (such as field speed $v$ and charge $\epsilon$). It is this predictable, reproducible configuration that provides the foundation for all measurement.

### An Emergent Unit of Distance

The radius of the stable binary orbit is the smallest possible radius for such a system. This invariant length serves as a natural, emergent unit of distance. We can denote this fundamental length as $d_0$.

-   **Definition:** $d_0$ is the radius of a stable, circular Electrino-Positrino orbit.
-   **Universality:** Any observer in the universe can, in principle, construct this standard by observing an isolated binary system.
-   **Function:** All other spatial measurements, from the size of more complex assemblies to the distances between them, can be expressed in terms of $d_0$.

### An Emergent Unit of Time

The motion within this stable orbit also provides a fundamental unit of time. The time it takes for the binary to complete one full revolution is its orbital period. Since the orbit has a minimum radius and a corresponding fixed speed, this period is the shortest possible for any binary assembly.

-   **Definition:** The fundamental unit of time, $t_0$, is the orbital period of a stable, circular Electrino-Positrino orbit.
-   **Universality:** Like the unit of distance, this period is a constant derived from the system's fundamental dynamics.
-   **Function:** All other temporal measurements, such as the duration of events or the lifetimes of unstable assemblies, can be measured in multiples of $t_0$.

### Establishing a Physical Coordinate System

With the emergent units $d_0$ and $t_0$, we can move from the abstract, uncalibrated coordinates of absolute space and time to a concrete, physical coordinate system. Any measurement of a physical quantity can be rendered dimensionless by expressing it in these natural units. For example, the fundamental field speed $v$ can be written as a constant multiple of $d_0/t_0$.

This framework establishes that while the *arena* of space and time is absolute, the *measurement* of space and time is necessarily relative to the properties of the emergent structures that populate it.



### Non-Markovian Memory and the Self-Hit Condition

1. **Self-Hit Definition**: A self-hit occurs when an architrino’s current trajectory $(\mathbf{x}(t))$ intersects the expanding causal isochron emitted by itself at a prior time $t_{hist}$.
2. **Intersection Logic**: In absolute Euclidean coordinates, find $t_{hist}$ such that:
   $$|\mathbf{x}(t) - \mathbf{x}(t_{hist})| = c_f (t - t_{hist})$$
3. **The Stability Mechanism**: Self-hit provides the non-linear "push-back" force required to prevent binary collapse. It replaces the "singularities" of 1/r potential with a high-curvature constraint derived from re-entering causal isochrons.
4. **Virtual Observer Diagnostics**: Simulation logs must record self-hit frequency and "provenance" (the age of the wake surface being hit) to distinguish stable Tri-Binary attractors from chaotic or decaying states.

## Self-Hit Detection and Logging (VO-based)

Frame self-hit as a path-history intersection problem:
- Find (t_emit, t_hit) such that:
  |x_emitter(t_hit) − x_emitter(t_emit)| = c_f (t_hit − t_emit)
  with same emitter identity

Simulation requirement:
- Use VO provenance tables to detect/count self-hit events:
  (emitter\_id, t\_hit, t\_emit, impact\_parameter, contribution\_strength)

Acceptance criteria:
- Self-hit event rates and distributions must converge under:
  - $\Delta$t refinement
  - history-resolution refinement
  - integrator swap
If self-hit signatures change qualitatively under refinement, treat as numerical artifact until proven otherwise.


### Self-Hit as a Path-History Intersection in the Absolute Frame

Self‑hit is the key non‑Markovian feature of architrino dynamics. It occurs when an architrino interacts with potential it emitted earlier along its own worldline.

**Geometric condition (absolute coordinates):**

For a given architrino with trajectory $\mathbf{x}(t)$, a self‑hit event is a pair of times $(t_\text{emit}, t_\text{hit})$ with $t_\text{hit} > t_\text{emit}$ such that:

$|\mathbf{x}(t_\text{hit}) - \mathbf{x}(t_\text{emit})| = c_f (t_\text{hit} - t_\text{emit}),$

 and the architrino is the source of the causal wake surface emitted at $t_\text{emit}$.

Because the underlying coordinates and time are absolute, this condition is unambiguous:

- The virtual observer knows $\mathbf{x}(t)$ for all $t$ and can solve for all such pairs $(t_\text{emit}, t_\text{hit})$ along the worldline.
- No coordinate‑gauge ambiguity enters the definition.

**Dynamical role:**

- At low velocities ($v < c_f$), self‑hit is rare or absent; dynamics are approximately Markovian.
- As velocities approach and exceed $c_f$, emission isochrons catch up with the emitter’s future positions, generating:
  - Nonlocal feedback on its motion.
  - Effective restoring or destabilizing forces depending on configuration.
- For binary and tri‑binary assemblies, repeated self‑hit events can:
  - Prevent collapse to singularity (short‑distance repulsion),
  - Lock in stable radii and frequencies (Noether‑core formation),
  - Create new limit cycles and attractors in phase space.

**Simulation & diagnostics:**

In simulations:

- Use virtual‑observer provenance tables to record, for each self‑hit:
  - $(t_\text{emit}, \mathbf{x}(t_\text{emit}))$,
  - $(t_\text{hit}, \mathbf{x}(t_\text{hit}))$,
  - Impact parameters and force contributions.
- Check convergence of self‑hit statistics under:
- Time step refinement,
- History resolution refinement,
- Different integrators.

If self‑hit signatures are numerically unstable under refinement, treat any resulting “stable structures” as artifacts until proven otherwise.


### Formalizing Self-Hit Geometry in Absolute Coordinates

The use of an Absolute Observer allows for a non-ambiguous definition of the self-hit condition.

1. **Coordinate Identification**: Because $(x,y,z)$ labels in the void are permanent, the "Self-Hit" occurs when a causal isochron emitted at $(\mathbf{x}_{em}, t_{em})$ intersects the source architrino at $(\mathbf{x}_{rec}, t_{rec})$ such that:
   $$|\mathbf{x}_{rec}(t_{rec}) - \mathbf{x}_{em}(t_{em})| = c_f (t_{rec} - t_{em})$$
2. **Path History**: The path is a straight Euclidean vector. Curvature is not in the path, but in the **deformation of the source's trajectory** due to the self-interaction force.
3. **Non-Markovian Memory**: The feedback loop at $t$ is determined by the position of the architrino at $t_{history}$. This prevents binary singularities; as $r \to 0$ and $v$ increases, the self-hit force provides a non-linear "push-back."


### Self-Hit in Absolute Coordinates

* **Definition:** A self-hit occurs when an architrino trajectory intersects its own past causal wake surface in the fixed frame.
* **Geometry:** The feedback loop is strictly non-Markovian. The "memory" is stored in the field at specific absolute coordinates.
* **Stability:** Self-hit provides the bounding force for the Noether core.

# Maximum-Curvature Circular Orbit (Opposite Charges)

**Goal**: Characterize the circular, constant-speed, constant-radius configuration of two opposite-charge architrinos and investigate where curvature $\kappa = 1/R$ is maximized. We work in units with field speed $c_f = 1$ and use the canonical delayed, purely radial per-hit law.

**Plain language**: We seek the tightest (smallest-$R$) steady circle an opposite-charge pair can trace when the only forces come from delayed, radial interactions with the partner (multiple-hits) and from one's own past emissions (self-hits, active only when speed exceeds field speed).

---

## Foundational Context (Ontological Clarification)

### The Maximal Curvature Binary (MCB) as Fundamental Unit

In the architrino framework, the **Maximal Curvature Binary (MCB)** is the **inner binary** of a tri-binary assembly, stabilized by self-hit dynamics when $v > c_f$. It defines the **fundamental physical units**:

- **Length standard**: The orbital radius $r_{\text{min}}$ of the MCB is the **prototype rod**.
- **Time standard**: The orbital period $T_{\text{MCB}} = 1/f_{\text{MCB}}$ is the **prototype clock tick**.

The MCB radius $r_{\text{min}}$ is determined by the balance of:
1. Coulomb-like attraction between opposite charges ($\propto |e/6|^2 / r^2$),
2. Self-hit repulsion (non-Markovian feedback when $v > c_f$),
3. Centripetal requirement for stable circular orbit.

**Expected scale**: $r_{\text{min}} \sim 10^{-15}$ to $10^{-12}$ m (classical electron radius to Compton wavelength).

### Relationship to Tri-Binary Structure

- **Inner binary** (MCB): $v > c_f$; self-hit stabilized; **defines fundamental units**.
- **Middle binary**: **always** at $v = c_f$ with **variable radius/frequency**; symmetry-breaking threshold and **energy-storage fulcrum**; defines effective light speed $c_{\text{eff}}$.
- **Outer binary**: $v < c_f$; expansion/contraction modes; **couples to Noether Sea** for gravitational/cosmological effects.

**This document analyzes the isolated two-body problem to understand MCB formation and stability.**

---

## Setup and Notation (Symmetric Frame)

- **Two architrinos** with charges $q_1 = -\epsilon$ and $q_2 = +\epsilon$ (where $\epsilon = |e/6|$).
- **Equal-time positions** (in absolute time $t$) are diametrically opposite on a circle of radius $R$ about the midpoint.
- **Uniform circular motion**: Angular speed $\omega$, constant tangential speed $s = R\omega$.
- **Non-translating binary**: Circle center (midpoint) is fixed in Euclidean 3D space; no net translation.

### Phase Angles and Delays

Let $\delta_s$ and $\delta_p$ denote the angular phase separations (measured along the circle) between:
- **Self** (same particle): Current position → its own past emission position that hits "now."
  - Delay time: $\tau_s$; angular separation: $\delta_s = \omega \tau_s$.
  - Chord length: $r_s = 2R \sin(\delta_s / 2)$.
  
- **Partner** (other particle): Current position → partner's past emission position that hits "now."
  - Delay time: $\tau_p$; angular separation: $\delta_p = \omega \tau_p$.
  - Chord length: $r_p = 2R \cos(\delta_p / 2)$.

### Causal-Time Constraints (Field Speed $c_f = 1$)

For a signal to travel from emission point to reception point:
$$
r = c_f \cdot \tau \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \tau \quad \text{(in units where } c_f = 1\text{)}.
$$

This yields two delay equations:

1. **Self-hit**:
   $$
   \delta_s = \omega \tau_s = \omega \cdot r_s = \omega \cdot 2R \sin(\delta_s / 2) = 2s \sin(\delta_s / 2).
   $$

2. **Partner hit**:
   $$
   \delta_p = \omega \tau_p = \omega \cdot r_p = \omega \cdot 2R \cos(\delta_p / 2) = 2s \cos(\delta_p / 2).
   $$

**These two transcendental equations determine** $(\delta_s, \delta_p)$ **as functions of speed** $s$.

**Critical threshold**: Self-hits exist only when $s > 1$ (i.e., $v > c_f$). For $s \le 1$, no self-hits occur.

---

### Terminology: Roots and Winding Numbers

**Root**: An emission time $t_0 < t$ (from either self or partner) that satisfies the causal constraint $r = c_f (t - t_0)$ and produces a hit at reception time $t$.

**Integer-indexed older roots (winding numbers)**:

Let $\tilde{\delta}_s \in (0, \pi]$ and $\tilde{\delta}_p \in (0, \pi]$ denote the **minimal (principal) angular separations** that determine the chord lengths and force directions.

The full families of causal delays are:

- **Self**: 
  $$
  \delta_s(m) = \tilde{\delta}_s + 2\pi m = 2s \sin(\tilde{\delta}_s / 2), \quad m = 0, 1, 2, \dots
  $$
  
- **Partner**: 
  $$
  \delta_p(m) = \tilde{\delta}_p + 2\pi m = 2s \cos(\tilde{\delta}_p / 2), \quad m = 0, 1, 2, \dots
  $$

**Geometric interpretation**:
- The minimal separations $\tilde{\delta}_s$, $\tilde{\delta}_p$ determine the **geometry** (chord lengths, force directions).
- The winding index $m$ affects **timing/ordering** of multiple hits but does not change the **sign** or **direction** of force components (all derived from principal geometry).

---

## Per-Hit Directions and Force Components

### Local Coordinate Frame at Receiver

- **Radial outward**: $\hat{e}_r$ (from rotation center toward receiver).
- **Tangential**: $\hat{e}_t$ (direction of motion along circle).

### Unit Directions of Lines of Action (Emission → Reception)

**Self-hit**:
$$
\hat{u}_s = \sin(\delta_s / 2) \, \hat{e}_r + \cos(\delta_s / 2) \, \hat{e}_t.
$$

**Partner hit** (geometric chord across circle):
$$
\hat{u}_p = \cos(\delta_p / 2) \, \hat{e}_r - \sin(\delta_p / 2) \, \hat{e}_t.
$$

### Canonical Per-Hit Accelerations

Using the delayed, radial law with magnitude $\kappa \epsilon^2 / r^2$ (where $\kappa$ is a coupling constant and $\epsilon = |e/6|$):

**Self-hit** (like charges → repulsive):
$$
\mathbf{a}_s = +\kappa \epsilon^2 \frac{1}{r_s^2} \hat{u}_s.
$$

**Partner hit** (opposite charges → attractive):
$$
\mathbf{a}_p = -\kappa \epsilon^2 \frac{1}{r_p^2} \hat{u}_p.
$$

---

### Radial and Tangential Components

Define **inward radial** as positive (toward center) and **tangential** as positive in direction of motion.

**Chord lengths**:
$$
r_s = 2R \sin(\delta_s / 2), \quad r_p = 2R \cos(\delta_p / 2).
$$

**Inward radial components**:

- **Self** (repulsive → outward → negative):
  $$
  A_{s,\text{rad}} = -\kappa \epsilon^2 \frac{\sin(\delta_s / 2)}{r_s^2} = -\frac{\kappa \epsilon^2}{4R^2 \sin(\delta_s / 2)}.
  $$

- **Partner** (attractive → inward → positive):
  $$
  A_{p,\text{rad}} = +\kappa \epsilon^2 \frac{\cos(\delta_p / 2)}{r_p^2} = +\frac{\kappa \epsilon^2}{4R^2 \cos(\delta_p / 2)}.
  $$

**Net inward radial acceleration**:
$$
A_{\text{rad}} = \frac{\kappa \epsilon^2}{4R^2} \left( \frac{1}{\cos(\delta_p / 2)} - \frac{1}{\sin(\delta_s / 2)} \right).
$$

**Tangential components** (both non-negative for $0 < \delta_s, \delta_p < \pi$):

- **Self**:
  $$
  T_s = +\kappa \epsilon^2 \frac{\cos(\delta_s / 2)}{r_s^2} = \frac{\kappa \epsilon^2 \cos(\delta_s / 2)}{4R^2 \sin^2(\delta_s / 2)}.
  $$

- **Partner**:
  $$
  T_p = +\kappa \epsilon^2 \frac{\sin(\delta_p / 2)}{r_p^2} = \frac{\kappa \epsilon^2 \sin(\delta_p / 2)}{4R^2 \cos^2(\delta_p / 2)}.
  $$

**Net tangential acceleration**:
$$
T = T_s + T_p \ge 0.
$$

---

### Sub-Field-Speed Simplification ($s \le 1$; No Self-Hits)

When $s \le 1$, self-hits do not occur ($\delta_s$ has no solution). Only the partner contributes:

$$
T(s < 1) = T_p = \frac{\kappa \epsilon^2}{4R^2} \frac{\sin(\delta_p / 2)}{\cos^2(\delta_p / 2)}.
$$

Using the delay relation $\delta_p = 2s \cos(\delta_p / 2)$:

$$
T(s < 1) = \frac{\kappa \epsilon^2 s^2}{R^2} \frac{\sin(\delta_p / 2)}{\delta_p^2} > 0.
$$

**Interpretation**: Even at sub-field speeds, there is always a **net positive tangential force** (accelerating the binary). This prevents a truly stable, constant-speed circular orbit.

---

## Requirements for True Circular Orbit

For uniform circular motion at fixed radius $R$ and constant speed $s$:

1. **Centripetal balance**:
   $$
   A_{\text{rad}} = \frac{s^2}{R}.
   $$

2. **Zero tangential power** (constant speed):
   $$
   T = 0.
   $$

---

### The Obstruction: Non-Negativity of Tangential Components

**Key Result**: For the symmetric, non-translating two-body circle geometry, and for **any** causal root (including all older roots with winding index $m \ge 0$), the tangential components satisfy:

$$
T_s \ge 0, \quad T_p \ge 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad T = T_s + T_p > 0.
$$

**Conclusion**: An isolated two-body system **cannot** achieve $T = 0$ under the canonical delayed, purely radial interaction law. A true constant-speed, fixed-radius circular orbit **does not exist** without additional physics:

- External fields or assemblies (e.g., embedding in Noether Sea),
- Modified interaction rules (e.g., velocity-dependent forces, radiation damping),
- Or multi-body stabilization (tri-binary structure with three nested pairs).

**Plain language**: In the isolated pair, tangential pushes never cancel, so a perfectly steady circle is not achievable. The binary will either spiral inward (if $T$ accelerates it past centripetal balance) or require external coupling to stabilize.

---

## What "Maximum Curvature" Demands

From the radial component formula:

$$
A_{\text{rad}} = \frac{\kappa \epsilon^2}{4R^2} \left( \frac{1}{\cos(\delta_p / 2)} - \frac{1}{\sin(\delta_s / 2)} \right).
$$

**Increasing curvature** ($\kappa = 1/R$ larger → $R$ smaller) requires **stronger inward radial force**. This occurs when:

1. **$\delta_p$ increases** → $\cos(\delta_p / 2)$ decreases → partner term $1/\cos(\delta_p / 2)$ **increases** (stronger inward pull).
2. **$\delta_s$ increases** → $\sin(\delta_s / 2)$ increases → self term $1/\sin(\delta_s / 2)$ **decreases** (weaker outward repulsion).

**Critical observation**: Near the self-hit threshold ($s \to 1^+$, $\delta_s \to 0^+$):

$$
\frac{1}{\sin(\delta_s / 2)} \to \infty \quad \text{(strong outward repulsion)}.
$$

Therefore, **just-above-threshold self-hits do not maximize curvature**—they **strongly oppose** it by blowing up the outward radial component.

**Maximum curvature** (smallest stable $R$) likely occurs at **higher speeds** ($s \gg 1$) where:
- Multiple self-hits ($m \ge 1$) are active,
- $\delta_s$ is large (approaching $\pi$),
- Outward self-repulsion is minimized while inward partner attraction is maximized.

**However**: Due to the $T > 0$ obstruction, this "maximum curvature" state is **not a stable equilibrium** for the isolated two-body system. It represents a **transient regime** or requires **external stabilization**.

---

## Self-Hit Multiplicity vs. Speed

**Definition**: A self-hit is an emission time from the same architrino that satisfies the causal constraint $r = (t - t_0)$ and arrives "now." In uniform circular, non-translating geometry, admissible self-roots are indexed by winding number $m \ge 0$ and minimal angular separation $\tilde{\delta}_s \in (0, \pi]$:

$$
\delta_s = \tilde{\delta}_s + 2\pi m = 2s \sin(\tilde{\delta}_s / 2).
$$

### Counting Self-Hits by Winding Index

A new self-hit branch (for winding $m$) appears when:

$$
s \ge s_m^\star = \frac{(2m + 1) \pi}{2}.
$$

Therefore, the number of distinct self-hits at speed $s$ is:

$$
N_{\text{self}}(s) = \begin{cases}
0, & s \le 1, \\
1 + \max\!\left(0, \left\lfloor \frac{s}{\pi} - \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor \right), & s > 1.
\end{cases}
$$

**Examples**:

- $1 < s < 3\pi/2 \approx 4.712$ → $N_{\text{self}} = 1$ (only $m = 0$).
- $s \ge 3\pi/2$ → $N_{\text{self}} \ge 2$ ($m = 0$ and $m = 1$).
- Higher $m$ branches turn on at $s \ge 5\pi/2$, $7\pi/2$, etc.

**Note**: Straight-line motion admits **no self-hits** even if $s > 1$; **curvature is required**. The above statements apply specifically to uniform circular, non-translating geometry.

---

## Where Do Causal Hits Come From on the Circle? (Discrete Azimuth Pattern)

**Context**: Non-translating, uniform circular binary at fixed speed $s$. Receiver "now" at azimuth $\theta = 0$.

The emission points on the circle that can produce hits "now" form a **finite, discrete set** of azimuths determined by the delay equations—**not arbitrary locations**.

### Partner Hits

- Minimal angular separation: $\tilde{\delta}_p \in (0, \pi]$.
- Causal delays:
  $$
  \delta_p(m) = \tilde{\delta}_p + 2\pi m = 2s \cos(\tilde{\delta}_p / 2), \quad m = 0, 1, 2, \dots
  $$

- **Emission azimuth** at reception:
  $$
  \varphi_p(m; s) = \pi - \tilde{\delta}_p(m; s).
  $$

- **Existence thresholds**: For each $m \ge 0$, a solution exists only if $s > m\pi$.
- As $m$ increases, $\tilde{\delta}_p$ decreases → $\varphi_p$ drifts monotonically toward $\pi$ (diametrically opposite point).

### Self-Hits

- Minimal angular separation: $\tilde{\delta}_s \in (0, \pi]$.
- Causal delays:
  $$
  \delta_s(m) = \tilde{\delta}_s + 2\pi m = 2s \sin(\tilde{\delta}_s / 2), \quad m = 0, 1, 2, \dots
  $$

- **Emission azimuth** at reception:
  $$
  \varphi_s(m; s) = -\tilde{\delta}_s(m; s).
  $$

- **Existence windows**:
  - Principal branch ($m = 0$): exists only for $1 < s \le \pi/2$; terminates at $\tilde{\delta}_s = \pi$ when $s = \pi/2$.
  - For $m \ge 1$: new branch appears when
    $$
    s \ge s_m^\star = \frac{(2m + 1) \pi}{2}.
    $$
  - Within a branch, $\tilde{\delta}_s$ decreases with $s$ → $\varphi_s$ drifts toward $-\pi$.

### Multiplicity and Pattern

- At any fixed $s$, the admissible emission azimuths form a **finite, ordered "comb"** of discrete points.
- These points accumulate toward the diametric opposite direction:
  - $\varphi = \pi$ for partner,
  - $\varphi = -\pi$ for self.
- As $s$ increases, the set grows in **steps** at the thresholds above; more roots appear but they **never fill the circle**.
- Multiple hits at the same "now" correspond to different winding indices $m$ (and occasionally multiple $\tilde{\delta}_s$ solutions within a branch); all are fixed by the delay equations and circle geometry.

**Plain language**: For a given speed, hits come from a **short list of specific angles** set by causality and delay—not from arbitrary points all around the circle. Going faster unlocks more of these specific angles at predictable threshold speeds.

## Practical Recipe (Computational)

To explore the two-body circular dynamics numerically:

1. **Pick a speed** $s > 1$ (to activate self-hits).

2. **Solve the delay equations**:
   $$
   \delta_s = 2s \sin(\delta_s / 2), \quad \delta_p = 2s \cos(\delta_p / 2),
   $$
   for $(\delta_s, \delta_p) \in (0, \pi]$ (principal solutions).

3. **Enumerate causal roots** by winding index $m \ge 0$:
   - Use minimal angular separations $\tilde{\delta}_s$, $\tilde{\delta}_p$ to compute chord lengths and force components.
   - Winding index $m$ affects emission timing/ordering but not the sign or direction of components (all derived from principal geometry).

4. **Compute radial and tangential accelerations**:
   $$
   A_{\text{rad}}(s), \quad T(s).
   $$
   Verify that $T(s) > 0$ (no constant-speed equilibrium without external physics).

5. **Identify speed regimes**:
   - Near $s \to 1^+$: Strong outward self-repulsion ($1/\sin(\delta_s/2) \to \infty$) → low curvature.
   - Higher $s$ ($s \gg 1$): Multiple self-hits active; $\delta_s$ large → outward repulsion minimized → higher curvature possible (but still not stable due to $T > 0$).

## Summary Answers

### Can an Isolated Two-Body System Form a Stable Circular Orbit?

**Yes—at the MCB (Maximal Curvature Binary) scale.**

An isolated electrino–positrino pair in an otherwise empty Euclidean void will naturally **spiral inward** under mutual attraction until they reach the **MCB configuration** at radius $r_{\text{min}}$, where self-hit dynamics stabilize the orbit.

**Dynamics**:

1. **Initial spiral-in** ($v < c_f$):
   - Partner attraction dominates.
   - Net tangential force $T > 0$ accelerates the binary.
   - Radius decreases; speed increases.

2. **Self-hit onset** ($v > c_f$):
   - Self-repulsion activates (non-Markovian feedback).
   - Begins to counteract inward collapse.

3. **Stabilization at MCB** ($v \gg c_f$, $r = r_{\text{min}}$):
   - Balance achieved between:
     - Partner attraction (multiple causal roots),
     - Self-repulsion (prevents $r \to 0$ singularity),
     - Centripetal requirement.
   - The orbit locks into a quasi-stable configuration at **maximal curvature**.

**Key Point**: The positive tangential force **drives the spiral-in**, and self-hit dynamics **halt the collapse** at finite $r_{\text{min}}$. This is the **natural attractor** for the isolated two-body system.

**No external physics required**: The MCB forms purely from the canonical delayed, radial interaction law plus self-hit feedback. No Noether Sea, no external fields, no multi-body configurations are necessary for this fundamental stable state.

### What Stabilizes the MCB?

**Self-hit repulsion** (non-Markovian feedback when $v > c_f$) is the critical stabilizing mechanism:

- **At large radii** ($r \gg r_{\text{min}}$): Partner attraction dominates → spiral inward.
- **Near the threshold** ($v \approx c_f$, $\delta_s \to 0$): Self-repulsion is strong but outward radial component diverges → **not** the stable point.
- **At high speeds** ($v \gg c_f$, $\delta_s \to \pi$): Self-repulsion is **minimized** in radial direction (emission from "behind"), but still sufficient to prevent collapse to $r = 0$ → **this is the MCB**.

**Ontological Implication**: The MCB is a **natural attractor** arising purely from architrino dynamics, not an imposed structure. It represents the **ground state** of the electrino–positrino system.

---

### Where Is Curvature Maximized?

**At the MCB**: The tightest stable orbit occurs when self-hit feedback exactly balances further inward collapse.

**Not** at the self-hit threshold ($s \to 1^+$):
- Near threshold, $\delta_s \to 0^+$ → $1/\sin(\delta_s/2) \to \infty$ → strong outward repulsion prevents tight orbits.

**At high speeds** ($s \gg 1$, $\delta_s \to \pi$):
- Self-emission comes from "behind" → radial component of self-repulsion is minimized.
- Multiple partner hits (older roots $m = 0, 1, 2, \dots$) provide cumulative inward pull.
- Balance occurs at finite $r_{\text{min}}$ → **maximum curvature** $\kappa = 1/r_{\text{min}}$.

---

### Relationship to Fundamental Units

The **Maximal Curvature Binary (MCB)** radius $r_{\text{min}}$ is:

- **Determined entirely by fundamental architrino dynamics**: No external physics required.
- **Emergent from the balance**:
  1. Coulomb-like attraction ($\propto \epsilon^2 / r^2$),
  2. Self-hit repulsion (non-Markovian feedback when $v > c_f$),
  3. Centripetal requirement for circular orbit.

- **Universal**: All electrino–positrino pairs in isolation will spiral to the same $r_{\text{min}}$ (modulo initial conditions that might lead to different final velocities, but the minimal stable radius should be a fixed attractor).

**This is the fundamental length scale of the theory**: $r_{\text{min}}$ is the **prototype rod**, and $T_{\text{MCB}} = 2\pi r_{\text{min}} / v_{\text{MCB}}$ is the **prototype clock tick**.

### Implications for Tri-Binary Formation

The MCB is the **building block** for larger assemblies:

- **Inner binary** (of a tri-binary): Operates at MCB scale; $v > c_f$; self-hit stabilized.
- **Middle and outer binaries**: Larger-radius, lower-energy configurations that may require:
  - Coupling to Noether Sea (for environmental stabilization),
  - Multi-body phase-locking (three nested binaries stabilize each other),
  - Or quantum-like selection rules (angular momentum quantization).

The existence of the MCB as a **natural attractor** in the isolated two-body problem is **foundational**—it proves the theory can generate stable structures without external scaffolding.

Further analysis (Ch. 11–13) will address:
- How tri-binaries form from multiple MCBs,
- What determines the radius ratios $r_{\text{inner}} : r_{\text{middle}} : r_{\text{outer}}$,
- Whether middle/outer binaries also have natural attractors or require environmental coupling.

## Notes

- **Self-hit threshold** ($s \to 1^+$): Near threshold, self radial term is large and **outward** ($\propto 1/\sin(\delta_s/2)$); tight orbits are **not** realized here. This is a **barrier**, not the final state.

- **High-speed regime** ($s \gg 1$, $\delta_s \to \pi$): Self-repulsion is minimized in the radial direction; the binary reaches **maximal curvature** at finite $r_{\text{min}}$. This is the **MCB attractor**.

- **Spiral-in is natural**: The positive tangential force $T > 0$ is the **mechanism** that drives the pair from initial separation to the MCB. Once at MCB, the configuration is quasi-stable (small oscillations may persist, but no further collapse).

- **No external coupling required** for MCB: The isolated two-body system self-organizes to MCB purely from canonical architrino dynamics. External physics (Noether Sea, multi-body configurations) becomes important for **larger assemblies** (middle/outer binaries, tri-binaries, particles).

- **Transition to tri-binary**: The MCB forms naturally in isolation. Larger tri-binary structures (with nested middle and outer binaries) likely require additional stabilization mechanisms, motivating the architecture of more complex assemblies and their coupling to the medium.

## Phil's Addendum: Ontological Takeaways

1. **The MCB is a natural attractor**: An isolated electrino–positrino pair will spiral inward to $r_{\text{min}}$ and stabilize there via self-hit dynamics. **No external physics required** for this fundamental structure.

2. **Self-hit prevents singularity**: The theory naturally avoids $r \to 0$ collapse without invoking quantum mechanics, uncertainty principles, or external constraints. Self-interaction with one's own past potential provides a **deterministic** mechanism for singularity resolution.

3. **Fundamental units are dynamically generated**: $r_{\text{min}}$ and $T_{\text{MCB}}$ emerge from the balance of forces in the two-body problem, not from external conventions or empirical input.

4. **MCB scale**: $r_{\text{min}} \sim 10^{-15}$ to $10^{-12}$ m (classical electron radius to Compton wavelength).

5. **Bridge from fundamental to operational**: The MCB is the **first emergent structure** with physical dimensions. All larger assemblies (atoms, particles, macroscopic matter) scale from this. Operational measurements (rulers, clocks) ultimately trace back to MCB oscillations.

6. **Tri-binary structure is more complex**: While the MCB forms naturally in isolation, tri-binary assemblies (with middle and outer binaries) likely require additional stabilization mechanisms (Noether Sea coupling, phase-locking, quantization).
