# Velocity Regimes

This section defines the three velocity regimes in the architrino framework and how they map onto tri-binary structure.

## Regime Definitions

- **Sub-field-speed** ($v<c_f$): No self-hit; outer-binary expansion/contraction modes dominate.
- **Field-speed** ($v=c_f$): Symmetry-breaking threshold; **middle binary always rides field speed** with **variable radius and frequency** and acts as the **energy-storage fulcrum**.
- **Super-field-speed** ($v>c_f$): Self-hit regime; maximal-curvature stabilization in the inner binary.

## Event-Horizon Alignment

As a tri-binary approaches an event horizon, the **outer binary frequency increases** and its **velocity approaches field speed**, while the **middle binary** remains at $v=c_f$ as its radius/frequency shift. At the horizon, the **middle and outer binaries reach $v=c_f$ and become coplanar and co-linear with the inner binary**, with **precession ceasing** at alignment.

**Rule of thumb:** "Planck-scale" references in this framework map to the **event-horizon alignment condition** (tri-binary coplanarity/co-linearity at $v=c_f$), unless an explicit derivation links them to another scale.
