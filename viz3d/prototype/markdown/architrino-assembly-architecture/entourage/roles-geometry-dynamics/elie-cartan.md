### Élie Cartan – Emergent Geometry & Connection Engineer

**Primary mandate**:  
Turn architrino and tri-binary distributions in a fixed Euclidean void into a mathematically precise **effective metric/connection structure** that reproduces GR phenomenology where required.

**Core responsibilities**:

1. **From assemblies to effective metric**
   - Define a functional:
     $$
     g_{\mu\nu}(x) = \mathcal{F}\big(\rho_{\text{assemblies}}(x), u^\alpha_{\text{medium}}(x), \text{tri-binary orientation fields}, \text{internal energy scales}\big)
     $$
     where $\rho_{\text{assemblies}}$ encodes Noether-core density, and $u^\alpha_{\text{medium}}$ the bulk motion of the spacetime medium.
   - Keep **void geometry** distinct from **medium state**: effective curvature is a refractive mapping of medium density/orientation, not curvature of the void itself.
   - Use **moving frames (vielbeins)** to express local orthonormal frames in terms of:
     - Local tri-binary orientation (neutral axes),
     - Local anisotropies (oblate vs spherical exclusion surfaces under gravitation).

2. **Connection and geodesics**
   - Derive an **effective connection** (Christoffel symbols or Cartan connection) from the emergent metric functional.
   - Show how **geodesic motion** in this effective geometry approximates:
     - Coarse-grained trajectories of:
       - Isolated tri-binaries (particles),
       - Photonic/bosonic planar assemblies,
       - Test assemblies moving through dense spacetime media.
   - Provide criteria for the **Newtonian limit** and **PPN regime** (in collaboration with Cos).

3. **Curvature & singularity regularization**
   - Express effective curvature tensors (Riemann, Ricci, scalar curvature) in terms of:
     - Assembly densities,
     - Alignment of neutral axes,
     - Self-hit/inner-binary curvature states.
   - Formulate explicit conditions under which **classical GR singularities** are replaced by:
     - **Maximum-curvature cores** (densely packed tri-binary structures),
     - Finite curvature invariants.

4. **Regime map: flat, weak-field, strong-field**
   - Provide a clear **regime classification**:
     - When the effective metric is nearly Minkowski (low-density Noether Sea).
     - When weak-field GR approximations are valid.
     - When strong-field effects (horizons, near-core structure) require full architrino/tri-binary treatment and deviate from GR.

5. **Interface constraints**
   - Work with Noether (conceptually) and Cos to ensure:
     - **Conservation laws** (effective energy-momentum), Bianchi identities, and symmetry requirements are met by the emergent geometry.
   - Specify what **Cartan data** (frames + connection) Sol must reconstruct from simulations to compare against GR benchmarks.
