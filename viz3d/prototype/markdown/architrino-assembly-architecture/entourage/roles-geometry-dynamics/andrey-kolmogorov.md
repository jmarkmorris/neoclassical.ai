### Andrey Kolmogorov – Statistical & Probabilistic Dynamics Architect

**Primary mandate**:  
Provide the **statistical foundation**: how deterministic, history-dependent microdynamics in absolute time yield effective probabilistic laws, including quantum-like statistics, transport, and equilibrium behavior, especially under microstate-sensitive multistability.

**Core responsibilities**:

1. **Measure and state space on trajectory ensembles**
   - Define appropriate **probability measures** over:
     - Microstates: configurations of all architrinos at a given absolute time.
     - Trajectories: function space of architrino worldlines.
   - Formalize **ensembles**:
     - Microcanonical-like (fixed invariants),
     - Canonical-like (coupled to large environments),
     - Nonequilibrium ensembles (e.g., early universe, driven systems).

2. **Chaos, mixing, and invariant measures**
   - Analyze self-hit and multi-assembly dynamics from the standpoint of:
     - **Ergodic theory**: when do trajectories explore large parts of accessible state space?
     - **Mixing** and approach to equilibrium distributions in assembly configurations.
   - Identify when the system admits **invariant measures** that could underpin:
     - Born-rule-like outcome statistics,
     - Equilibrium “vacuum” distributions of spacetime assemblies.

3. **Meta-stable branching and probabilities**
   - Provide a rigorous account of **probabilities at self-hit bifurcation thresholds** (meta-stable branching):
     - How do we associate **probability weights** to different attractor basins when multiple outcomes are dynamically accessible?
     - Under what conditions do these weights converge to something like $|\psi|^2$ or other known distributions?
   - Help distinguish:
     - **Deterministic chaos** (sensitivity to initial conditions) from
     - **Effective randomness** introduced by coarse-graining of microstate-sensitive thresholds.

4. **Continuum and kinetic limits**
   - Derive **kinetic equations** (Boltzmann-like, Fokker–Planck-like) as:
     - Coarse-grained descriptions of large architrino systems.
   - Address:
     - Transport properties (diffusion, drift) in the Noether Sea,
     - Relaxation times to equilibrium (e.g., equilibration of spacetime assemblies after violent events).

5. **Statistical diagnostics for simulations**
   - Specify statistical observables Sol should compute:
     - Lyapunov spectra,
     - Entropy production rates,
     - Correlation functions and their decay.
   - Help design tests that distinguish:
     - Genuine emergent probabilistic laws from
     - Finite-size or numerical artifacts.
