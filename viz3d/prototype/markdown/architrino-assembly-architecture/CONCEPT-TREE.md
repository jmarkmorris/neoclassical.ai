## Concept Tree (High-Level)

- **Substrate**
  - Euclidean void + absolute time (δ_{ij}, global t)
  - Noether-core sea as medium (density, strain, refractive index)

- **Fundamental Dynamics**
  - Architrinos (±|e/6|) emitting/receiving delayed potential
  - Self-hit regime (v > c_f) → maximal curvature binaries; units of length/time

- **Assemblies**
  - Binaries → tri-binaries (inner/middle/outer) → Noether cores (pro/anti lattice)
  - Ellipsoidal vs planar geometry ↔ fermionic vs bosonic behavior; spin-statistics

- **Standard Model Mapping**
  - Decoration rules → charge quantization (0, ±e/3, ±2e/3, ±e)
  - Color from tri-binary personality distribution; SU(3)
  - Weak isospin / hypercharge from geometric degrees; SU(2)×U(1)
  - Bosons as planar trains/meta-assemblies (photons, gluons, W/Z, Higgs coupling)

- **Spacetime / Gravity**
  - Noether-core density/strain → c_eff(x); refraction maps to g_{\mu\nu}
  - Proper time from assembly clocks; recover PPN targets (γ, β), GW speed
  - Singularity resolution via maximal packing/Planck-density cores

- **Cosmology**
  - Medium evolution sets H(z); expansion as energy flow in tri-binary outer modes
  - CMB features from medium launch/oscillations; structure growth (σ₈/S₈)
  - Tensions: H₀, σ₈; N_eff from neutrino/sea coupling

- **Simulations & Validation**
  - Absolute-frame DDE integrators; VO logging; convergence/history resolution
  - Synthetic observables: scattering, form factors, GW/EM signals, cosmology mocks

- **Constraints & Adversarial**
  - Tier-1 hard walls: Lorentz bounds, GW speed, EP, proton stability, charge quantization
  - Stop conditions: parameter bloat, repeated empirical failures, unfalsifiability



## Mapping Assemblies ↔ SM ↔ GR ↔ Cosmology

**Purpose:** quick, high-level node list showing how the assembly architecture ties into the Standard Model, emergent GR, and cosmology.

### Core Nodes
- **Substrate:** Euclidean void + absolute time; Noether-core sea as medium.
- **Fundamentals:** architrinos (±|e/6|), delayed potential, self-hit regime.
- **Assemblies:** binaries → tri-binaries → Noether cores (pro/anti lattice).
- **Particle Map (SM):** ellipsoidal tri-binaries (fermions), planar tri-binaries (bosons), decoration rules → SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) charges.
- **Gauge Structure:** color from tri-binary personality distribution; weak isospin from ellipsoidal degrees; hypercharge from decoration.
- **Spacetime / GR Limit:** refractive medium → effective metric g_{\mu\nu}; proper time from assembly clocks; PPN targets.
- **Cosmology:** medium expansion/energy flow → H(z), CMB acoustic features, structure growth (σ₈/S₈).
- **Constraints & Tests:** Tier-1 bounds (Lorentz, GW speed, EP), precision SM pulls (g-2, CKM), cosmological tensions (H₀, σ₈).

### Key Links (Edges)
- Substrate → Fundamentals: absolute frame sets causal wake surfaces and self-hit condition.
- Fundamentals → Assemblies: self-hit stabilizes binaries; nested scales yield tri-binaries and Noether cores.
- Assemblies → Particle Map: geometry + decoration rules fix charges, spins, and family structure; links to SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1).
- Assemblies → Gauge Structure: vortex coupling ↔ gluons; planar trains ↔ photons; ellipsoidal tilts ↔ weak bosons/Higgs coupling.
- Assemblies → Spacetime: Noether-core density/strain modulates c_eff; refraction field maps to g_{\mu\nu}.
- Spacetime ↔ GR Limit: recover PPN γ, β, Shapiro delay, light bending, GW speed in weak-field; deviations at high density/self-hit.
- Spacetime → Cosmology: medium expansion history sets H(z); density/temperature of sea shapes CMB peaks and structure growth.
- Particle Map ↔ Cosmology: neutrino sector, baryogenesis pathways, and dark-sector equivalents affect N_eff, Y_p, matter power spectrum.
- Constraints → All: Tier-1/2 ledgers gate viability; empirical scorecards track pass/fail across SM precision, GR tests, and cosmology.
