## Network Map (Assemblies ↔ SM ↔ GR ↔ Cosmology)

**Purpose:** quick, high-level node list showing how the assembly architecture ties into the Standard Model, emergent GR, and cosmology.

### Core Nodes
- **Substrate:** Euclidean void + absolute time; Noether-core sea as medium.
- **Fundamentals:** architrinos (±|e/6|), delayed potential, self-hit regime.
- **Assemblies:** binaries → tri-binaries → Noether cores (pro/anti lattice).
- **Particle Map (SM):** ellipsoidal tri-binaries (fermions), planar tri-binaries (bosons), decoration rules → SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) charges.
- **Gauge Structure:** color from tri-binary personality distribution; weak isospin from ellipsoidal degrees; hypercharge from decoration.
- **Spacetime / GR Limit:** refractive medium → effective metric g_{\mu\nu}; proper time from assembly clocks; PPN targets.
- **Cosmology:** medium expansion/energy flow → H(z), CMB acoustic features, structure growth (σ₈/S₈).
- **Constraints & Tests:** Tier-1 bounds (Lorentz, GW speed, EP), precision SM pulls (g-2, CKM), cosmological tensions (H₀, σ₈).

### Key Links (Edges)
- Substrate → Fundamentals: absolute frame sets causal wake surfaces and self-hit condition.
- Fundamentals → Assemblies: self-hit stabilizes binaries; nested scales yield tri-binaries and Noether cores.
- Assemblies → Particle Map: geometry + decoration rules fix charges, spins, and family structure; links to SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1).
- Assemblies → Gauge Structure: vortex coupling ↔ gluons; planar trains ↔ photons; ellipsoidal tilts ↔ weak bosons/Higgs coupling.
- Assemblies → Spacetime: Noether-core density/strain modulates c_eff; refraction field maps to g_{\mu\nu}.
- Spacetime ↔ GR Limit: recover PPN γ, β, Shapiro delay, light bending, GW speed in weak-field; deviations at high density/self-hit.
- Spacetime → Cosmology: medium expansion history sets H(z); density/temperature of sea shapes CMB peaks and structure growth.
- Particle Map ↔ Cosmology: neutrino sector, baryogenesis pathways, and dark-sector equivalents affect N_eff, Y_p, matter power spectrum.
- Constraints → All: Tier-1/2 ledgers gate viability; empirical scorecards track pass/fail across SM precision, GR tests, and cosmology.
