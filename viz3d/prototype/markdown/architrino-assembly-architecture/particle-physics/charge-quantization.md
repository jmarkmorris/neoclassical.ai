### The $e/6$ Basis and Charge Emergence

1. **Fundamental Unit**: The architrino carries a "personality charge" magnitude of $|q| = e/6$.
2. **Quantization Rule**: Observed charges ($1/3, 2/3, 1$) are the only geometric clusterings of architrinos on the Tri-Binary surface that are dynamically stable under self-hit constraints in the Absolute Frame.
3. **Indivisibility**: Because there is no creation or annihilation, $e/6$ is the indivisible "atom" of charge.

### Quantization from Stability

* **Base Unit:** Architrino charge $|e/6|$.
* **Noether Core:** Neutral base (3 pro + 3 anti).
* **Observed Charges:** Only specific decorations (1/3, 2/3, 1) are stable under self-hit dynamics in the Absolute Frame.
* **Indivisibility:** No creation/annihilation means charge is conserved by counting entities.
