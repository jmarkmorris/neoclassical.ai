### Entries Related to Absolute Observer & Substrate

Add to the “Explanatory Scoreboard”:

- **Measurement Problem (QM)**
  - *Standard Theories*: Collapse postulates; many‑worlds branching; operationalist interpretations; unresolved debate.
  - *Architrino + Absolute Observer*: No fundamental collapse; one global micro‑history S(t); measurement = interaction between assemblies; virtual observer sees deterministic evolution; probabilities arise from coarse‑graining and ignorance of initial conditions.

- **Background Independence**
  - *GR*: Spacetime metric dynamical; coordinates gauge; strong notion of background independence.
  - *Architrino*: Fixed Euclidean background and absolute time; metric is emergent from Noether‑core medium; background independence appears only in the effective description (g_{$\mu$$\nu$}) used by physical observers; underlying micro‑equations are background‑dependent by design.

- **Relativity of Simultaneity**
  - *SR/GR*: Simultaneity is frame- or foliation-dependent; no global 'now'.
  - *Architrino*: Absolute time gives a unique global 'now' for the virtual observer; relativity of simultaneity is emergent from how assembly clocks and signals behave in the medium, not fundamental ontology.

For each of these, score the architrino framework on:
- Clarity of micro‑ontology,
- Ability to reproduce known phenomena,
- Presence of new, testable predictions (e.g. Lorentz deviations in extreme regimes).
