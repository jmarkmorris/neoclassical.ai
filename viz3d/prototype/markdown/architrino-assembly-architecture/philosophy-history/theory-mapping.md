# Theory Mapping: Major Physics Theories (Core Idea, Intuition, Math)

**Purpose:** A compact, cross-audience map of major theories as commonly presented
in outreach. Each entry is ordered **reverse**: (1) high-level summary, (2) an
abstract STEM-friendly view, (3) the mathematical essence (key idea or formula).

**Note:** This is descriptive, not an endorsement.

## 1. Core Assembly Layer (Noether Core / Tri-Binary)

These are particle-physics level theories that map most directly to assemblies,
decorations, and interaction rules. In the architrino view, they are effective
summaries of assembly microdynamics rather than fundamental entities.

### Standard Model (SM)

**Summary:** The unified framework describing all known particles and forces
except gravity.

**Conceptual View:** A gauge theory with group SU(3)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1) plus the
Higgs sector, with matter in three families.

at every spacetime point. Particle creation/annihilation emerges from field
operators.

$$
S=\int d^4x\; \left(\frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu\phi\,\partial^\mu\phi
-\frac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2 - V(\phi)\right).
$$

$$

---

### Electroweak Theory (EW)

**Summary:** Unifies electromagnetic and weak interactions via symmetry breaking.

without a fundamental scalar.

**Key Equation:** Dynamical symmetry breaking (schematic):
$$
\langle \bar\Psi \Psi \rangle \neq 0 \Rightarrow \text{EW breaking}.
$$

These are theories about spacetime structure and gravitational dynamics. In the
architrino view, they are emergent descriptions of how the Noether-core medium
modulates signal speeds, clock rates, and effective geometry.

### General Relativity (GR)

**Summary:** Gravity is not a force; it is the curvature of spacetime caused by
energy and momentum.

**Conceptual View:** Matter tells spacetime how to curve; curved spacetime tells matter
how to move. Free-fall follows geodesics, and gravitational waves are ripples in
the metric.

## 3. Cosmology / Large-Scale Assembly Evolution

These theories describe the universe at large scales: expansion history,
structure formation, and cosmic origins. In the architrino view, they map to
how spacetime assemblies evolve, cool, and transport energy across epochs.

### Lambda-CDM (Big Bang Cosmology)

**Summary:** The standard Big Bang cosmology: dark energy ($\Lambda$) plus cold
dark matter (CDM) in an expanding universe.

**Conceptual View:** Uses the Friedmann equations with a cosmological constant
and pressureless dark matter to fit CMB, BAO, and LSS data.

**Key Equation:** Friedmann equation:

### Steady-State / Quasi-Steady-State (Hoyle--Narlikar--Burbidge)

**Summary:** The universe is eternal on large scales; matter is continuously
created to keep density constant.

**Conceptual View:** Expansion occurs, but creation fields (or episodic creation
events) restore large-scale uniformity. Explains redshift without a singular
beginning.

**Key Equation:** Creation field (C-field) modifies Einstein equations:
$$
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G (T_{\mu\nu} + T^{(C)}_{\mu\nu}).
$$

---

### Ekpyrotic / Cyclic Cosmology (Steinhardt--Turok)

**Summary:** The universe undergoes repeated cycles of contraction and bounce.

**Conceptual View:** A slow contracting phase smooths and flattens the universe, then
a bounce leads to expansion.

**Key Equation:** Contracting equation-of-state:
$$
w \gg 1 \Rightarrow a(t) \propto (-t)^{2/3(1+w)}.
$$

---

### Bounce Cosmologies (Generic)

**Summary:** The big bang is replaced by a bounce from a prior contraction.

**Conceptual View:** Modified gravity or quantum effects avoid a singularity and
reverse collapse into expansion.

**Key Equation:** Non-singular bounce condition:
$$
H = 0,\quad \dot H > 0.
$$

---

### Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (Penrose)

**Summary:** The remote future of one universe becomes the big bang of the next.

\tilde g_{\mu\nu} = \Omega^2 g_{\mu\nu}.
$$

---

### Multiverse (Generic)

**Summary:** Our universe may be one of many with varying physical parameters.

**Conceptual View:** Arises in different contexts: eternal inflation, string
landscape, or quantum branching. Testability is debated.

**Key Equation:** Often formalized via measures over vacuum states or branches,
not a single canonical equation.

---

### Anthropic Principle

**Summary:** Physical parameters appear fine-tuned because only certain values
allow observers to exist.

large ensemble of universes or domains.

**Key Equation:** Bayesian conditioning on observer existence:

P(\theta \mid \mathrm{obs}) \propto P(\mathrm{obs}\mid\theta)P(\theta).
$$
Here, $\mathrm{obs}$ denotes observer existence.

---

## 4. Epistemic / Effective Theories of Observation

These are theories and interpretations that describe how observers access and
summarize dynamics: coarse-graining, probabilities, and measurement update.
In the architrino view, they sit at the physical-observer (PO) level.

### Quantum Mechanics (QM)

**Summary:** Physical systems are described by a wavefunction whose squared
magnitude gives probabilities of measurement outcomes.

collapse.

the cut is pragmatic, not fundamental.

**Key Equation:** Projection postulate:
$$
|\psi\rangle \to \frac{P_a |\psi\rangle}{\|P_a |\psi\rangle\|}.
$$

---

### Many-Worlds (Everett)

**Summary:** All possible outcomes occur, each in its own branch of the
universe.

**Conceptual View:** The wavefunction never collapses. Decoherence yields branches
that appear classical to observers.

**Key Equation:** Unitary evolution only:
$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi\rangle = \hat H |\psi\rangle,
$$
with no collapse postulate.

---

### de Broglie--Bohm (Pilot-Wave)

**Summary:** Particles have definite positions guided by a wavefunction.

**Conceptual View:** Deterministic trajectories with a guiding equation. Apparent
quantum randomness reflects ignorance of initial conditions.
