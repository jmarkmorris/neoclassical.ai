### Multi-Body Assembly Structure

1. **Nucleons as Defects**: Protons and neutrons are modeled as stable excitations or "defects" within the background Noether Sea.
2. **Nuclear Force**: The "Strong Force" is the residual interaction between Tri-Binary assemblies at short range (approaching the $v = c_f$ self-hit limit).
3. **Superfluid Vacuum**: Given the Helium-like (2 pro + 2 anti) coupling of the vacuum cores, the vacuum should be analyzed as a superfluid medium. This explains inertia as motion without resistance until a critical energy threshold is reached.
4. **Atomic Resonance**: Atomic orbitals are standing-wave resonances of architrino decorations within the aether lattice.


### Nuclear Physics in the Noether Sea

1. **Vacuum Interaction**: Nucleons are not isolated; they are excitations/defects within the dense medium of coupled pro/anti Noether cores.
2. **Binding Energy**: Calculation of binding energy must account for the pressure/tension exerted by the surrounding "Sea."
3. **Aether Density**: We define the local vacuum density $\rho_{nc}$ as a scalar field on the $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state grid.


### Nuclear Physics in the Sea of Cores

* **Binding Energy:** Nucleons are defects/excitations in the dense Noether core medium. Binding energy involves pressure from the surrounding sea.
* **Aether Density:** Use the $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective to map local vacuum density; this affects binding constants.
