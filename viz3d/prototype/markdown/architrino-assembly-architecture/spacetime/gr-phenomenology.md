## Strong-Field Deviations

Deviations from GR should be framed in terms of **event-horizon alignment conditions** in the tri-binary architecture: as the outer binary approaches $v=c_f$ and the middle binary remains at $v=c_f$, the system aligns coplanar/co-linear with the inner binary and precession ceases. Strong-field departures should be interpreted through that alignment condition rather than equating Planck scale with inner-binary maximal curvature.
