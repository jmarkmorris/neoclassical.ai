make an app page that shows a 3D ellipsoid volume, 
    - maybe three orthogonal views. 
    - eventually animate the orbit, path, trinos, etc
    - add slider for velocity (nines of c?)
    - a dashboard of measures about the "volume"
        - it's strange to think of volume when in some cases it is moving so fast.
    - show axes tilting as oblateness occurs
    - each release of an h causes r adjustment to middle and outer orbits.
    - we need to show formulas to learn what depends on what and why
        - look for the beta factor from lorentz
    - as it drops towards 0 Hz and some point it must fall apart?
    - offer different spiral functions (exponential, etc.)
    - frequency intuitions
    - frequency to radius and velocity of the outer binary as an unknown function. 

closed form equations?
    - seems like AI should be able to do the math to calculate the 'energy' accounted for passing through an enclosing sphere.
    - is this a constant?
    - how has the superposition changed the radiation from the three binaries independently


every H change is a result of work. 
    - the work on transfter of an h to the core must do all of the following
        - increase the translation velocity
        - increase the outer binary velocity (transverse)
        - decrease the outer binary radius
        - kick the middle binary into self hit and lock 2H into storage
        - the middle binary settles back on the symmetry but at a smaller radius,  but still at field speed.
        - increases outer binary frequency by 1
    - also is the natural state that translational velocity matches the orthogonal planar velocity?  
        - velocity is distance over time which is circumference. 
        - this way of expressing it is also accounting for l r spin.

inside the black hole
    what happens here?
    does it stay planar
    or flip the other way

    - is the lowest energy state when the propagation velocity equals the planer  orthogonal velocity?
        - that kind of maps out like a right triangle, which is kind of interesting 
        - how does that play out at speeds from 0 to cf?

    - show that acceleration goes into operating this mechanism
    - momentum is the stored H
    - is the inner binary also changing with each frequency increment. It could jump in units of 2 hz or 4 hz for example.

    - what would it mean for a core to have it's frequencies out of whack?  
        - in the outer it would be more reactive
        - what causes different forms of radioactive emission 
        - it is some form of particle decay.  
        - so it is something in the assembly that has it excited.
        - I would think the binaries are far higher energy than the personality charges
        - food for thought.
        - this may also relate to temperature and what implements temperature

- look for a research that links ellipsoids to the mathematics of general relativity ellipsoid’s
