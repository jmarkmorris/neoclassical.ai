# Quantum Number Mapping: Architrino Geometry to Standard Model

## Purpose
This document establishes the canonical dictionary translating **Tri-Binary Assembly Geometry** into **Standard Model (SM) Quantum Numbers**.

It adopts the **Nucleus + Personality** model:
1.  **The Nucleus (Noether Core):** A neutral, rotating tri-binary structure that defines the particle's generation, mass scale, and matter/antimatter chirality.
2.  **The Personality (Decoration):** A layer of 6 charged architrinos occupying polar sites on the Nucleus, defining the electric charge, weak isospin, and color charge.

---

## The Assembly Architecture

### The Fundamental Substrate
*   **Architrino Charge ($\epsilon$):** Magnitude $|e/6|$.
*   **Polarity:**
    *   **Positrino ($P$):** Charge $+1\epsilon$.
    *   **Electrino ($E$):** Charge $-1\epsilon$.

### The Nucleus (Noether Core)
Every fermion contains a central engine composed of nested binary pairs.
*   **Composition:** Each binary contains 1 Positrino + 1 Electrino (Neutral).
*   **Generation I Nucleus (Tri-Binary):** 3 Nested Binaries (Inner, Middle, Outer). Total 6 architrinos (3P, 3E).
*   **Chirality (Matter vs. Antimatter):**
    *   **Pro-Core:** The braiding/precession of the binaries follows a "Left-Handed" (Matter) orientation.
    *   **Anti-Core:** The braiding/precession follows a "Right-Handed" (Antimatter) orientation.
*   **Net Charge:** Always $0$.

### The Personality Layer (Decorations)
*   **Sites:** 6 Polar regions available for decoration.
*   **Occupancy:** All stable fermions have all 6 sites filled.
*   **Function:** This layer interacts with external fields (EM, Weak).

### Total Constituent Count (Gen I)
*   **Nucleus (6) + Personality (6) = 12 Architrinos.**

---

## The Fermion Mapping (Generation I)

All Generation I particles utilize the full **Tri-Binary Nucleus** (3 Binaries).

### Leptons

**The Electron ($e^-$)**
*   **Nucleus:** Pro-Tri-Binary (3P, 3E, Neutral, Matter-chirality).
*   **Personality:** 6 Electrinos ($6E$).
*   **Net Charge:** $0 (\text{core}) - 6\epsilon (\text{dec}) = -6\epsilon = -1e$.
*   **Total Count:** 12 Architrinos.

**The Positron ($e^+$)**
*   **Nucleus:** Anti-Tri-Binary (3P, 3E, Neutral, Antimatter-chirality).
*   **Personality:** 6 Positrinos ($6P$).
*   **Net Charge:** $0 + 6\epsilon = +1e$.
*   **Note:** Antimatter is a geometric inversion of *both* the core braiding and the decoration polarity.

**The Electron Neutrino ($\nu_e$)**
*   **Nucleus:** Pro-Tri-Binary.
*   **Personality:** 3 Positrinos, 3 Electrinos ($3P, 3E$).
*   **Net Charge:** $0$.
*   **Note:** The oscillating dipole moments of the personality layer are perfectly balanced, minimizing EM coupling.

### Quarks

**The Up Quark ($u$)**
*   **Nucleus:** Pro-Tri-Binary.
*   **Personality:** 5 Positrinos, 1 Electrino ($5P, 1E$).
*   **Net Charge:** $+5\epsilon - 1\epsilon = +4\epsilon = +2/3e$.

**The Down Quark ($d$)**
*   **Nucleus:** Pro-Tri-Binary.
*   **Personality:** 2 Positrinos, 4 Electrinos ($2P, 4E$).
*   **Net Charge:** $+2\epsilon - 4\epsilon = -2\epsilon = -1/3e$.

### Summary Table (Gen I)

| Particle | Nucleus Type | Decoration (Personality) | Net Charge ($e$) | Total Architrinos |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Electron** ($e^-$) | Pro-Tri-Binary | 6E | -1 | 12 |
| **Positron** ($e^+$) | Anti-Tri-Binary | 6P | +1 | 12 |

## Weak Isospin ($T_3$) and Chirality

In the Standard Model, the Weak Force only acts on "Left-Handed" particles. It transforms members of a doublet (e.g., $e^- \leftrightarrow \nu_e$) into each other. We map this to the **Active Triad Hypothesis**.

### The Active Triad Geometry
Every fermion personality layer consists of 6 polar sites. We hypothesize that these are organized into two groups based on the tri-binary rotation axis:
1.  **The Shielded Triad (3 sites):** Geometrically locked or obscured by the binary precession. These decorations *cannot* be swapped without destroying the particle.
2.  **The Active Triad (3 sites):** Exposed to the Noether Sea. These are the "switchable bits."

**Weak Isospin ($T_3$)** is defined by the polarity of this **Active Triad**:
*   **$T_3 = +1/2$ (Up-State):** The Active Triad contains maximal **Positrinos** (relative to the baseline).
*   **$T_3 = -1/2$ (Down-State):** The Active Triad contains maximal **Electrinos**.

### Mapping the Doublets

**The Lepton Doublet ($\nu_e, e^-_L$)**
*   **Base (Shielded):** 3 Electrinos ($3E$).
*   **Neutrino ($\nu_e$):** Shielded ($3E$) + Active ($3P$).
    *   Net: $3E, 3P$ (Neutral).
    *   State: Active Triad is Positive $\to T_3 = +1/2$.
*   **Electron ($e^-_L$):** Shielded ($3E$) + Active ($3E$).
    *   Net: $6E$ (Charge -1).
    *   State: Active Triad is Negative $\to T_3 = -1/2$.
*   **The Transformation:** The $W^-$ boson is the packet that removes $3P$ and replaces them with $3E$.

**The Quark Doublet ($u_L, d_L$)**
*   **Base (Shielded):** 2 Positrinos, 1 Electrino ($2P, 1E$).
*   **Up Quark ($u_L$):** Shielded ($2P, 1E$) + Active ($3P$).
    *   Net: $5P, 1E$ (Charge +2/3).
    *   State: Active Triad is Positive $\to T_3 = +1/2$.
*   **Down Quark ($d_L$):** Shielded ($2P, 1E$) + Active ($3E$).
    *   Net: $2P, 4E$ (Charge -1/3).
    *   State: Active Triad is Negative $\to T_3 = -1/2$.

### Gell-Mann–Nishijima Consistency Check
Does this geometry satisfy $Q = T_3 + \frac{Y_W}{2}$?

**Leptons (Hypercharge $Y_W = -1$):**
*   $\nu_e$: $T_3 (+1/2) + Y_W/2 (-1/2) = 0$. (Matches Geometry: 3P3E = 0).
*   $e^-$: $T_3 (-1/2) + Y_W/2 (-1/2) = -1$. (Matches Geometry: 6E = -1).

**Quarks (Hypercharge $Y_W = +1/3$):**
*   $u$: $T_3 (+1/2) + Y_W/2 (+1/6)$. *Wait... Standard Model Y is +1/3. (+1/2 + 1/6 = 2/3).* Correct.
*   $d$: $T_3 (-1/2) + Y_W/2 (+1/6) = -1/3$. Correct.
*   *Geometric Insight:* **Hypercharge ($Y_W$)** corresponds to the charge of the **Shielded Triad** plus the Core offset!
    *   Lepton Shielded Triad ($3E$) = $-1/2$ charge? No, charge is -1/2e.
    *   *Correction:* This suggests Hypercharge is physically stored in the **Shielded Triad**.

### Chirality (Why Right-Handed = 0?)
Why can't a Right-Handed Electron ($e^-_R$) turn into a Neutrino?
*   **Geometric Mechanism:** Chirality is the alignment of the particle's **Spin** with its **Momentum**.
*   **Lock-out:** In the "Right-Handed" configuration, the **Active Triad** is geometrically rotated *into the wake* of the particle or shielded by the binary arms.
*   **Result:** The $W$ boson (which has its own helicity) cannot physically "dock" with the Active Triad to perform the swap. It bounces off.
*   Therefore, $e^-_R$ has no "Active" Triad accessible to the Weak force. $T_3 = 0$.

## Color Charge and Strong Confinement

In the Standard Model, Quarks carry one of three "colors" (Red, Green, Blue). Leptons are "colorless" (White). We map Color to the **Azimuthal Phase Phase** of the Personality Layer.

### The Definition of Color
The Tri-binary nucleus rotates at extreme frequency ($v \approx c$). The 6 decoration sites are distributed around this rotating manifold.

*   **Symmetry Breaking:**
    *   **Leptons ($e^-$):** Decoration is $6E$. Perfectly symmetric. The charge distribution is isotropic (spherical approximation). **Result:** Colorless (White).
    *   **Quarks ($u, d$):** Decoration is Asymmetric ($5P, 1E$ or $2P, 4E$). This creates a **dipole or quadrupole moment** perpendicular to the rotation axis.
*   **Color as Phase:**
    *   **Red ($R$):** The asymmetry (e.g., the lone Electrino in $u$) is phase-locked at $0^\circ$ relative to the nuclear spin vector.
    *   **Green ($G$):** The asymmetry is phase-locked at $120^\circ$.
    *   **Blue ($B$):** The asymmetry is phase-locked at $240^\circ$.

### Confinement (The Flux Tube)
Because quarks have this rotating asymmetry, they churn the surrounding Noether Sea violently, creating a **vortex filament** (Flux Tube).
*   **Single Quark:** The vortex creates infinite drag/energy (linear potential $V \propto r$). This is why free quarks are forbidden.
*   **Meson ($q \bar{q}$):** A Red Quark ($0^\circ$) and Anti-Red Quark ($180^\circ$ inverted) cancel the phase disturbance locally. The flux tube connects them, effectively "closing the circuit."
*   **Baryon ($qqq$):**
    *   If we combine $R + G + B$ ($0^\circ + 120^\circ + 240^\circ$), the net phase disturbance vector sums to **zero**.
    *   $\vec{V}_{net} = \vec{v}_R + \vec{v}_G + \vec{v}_B = 0$.
    *   The vortex lines from the three quarks merge in the center (the "Y-junction" or "Mercedes-Benz" string configuration) and cancel out at a distance. The assembly looks "White" (symmetric) to the outside world.

### Gluons
Gluons are the **phase-correction packets** exchanged between quarks to maintain this balance.
*   If a Red Quark drifts to $10^\circ$, it emits a Gluon (carrying phase momentum) that is absorbed by a Green Quark, shifting it accordingly to maintain the center-of-mass neutrality.
*   **Geometry:** Gluons are planar architrino structures (2D ribbons) that propagate along the flux tubes, transferring angular momentum (Color) between vertices.

### Color phase alignment and decoherence suppression

- **Restoring force:** The shared flux tube has a tension that is minimum when the three color phases sum to zero. Any phase slip stretches the tube and raises its energy, pulling phases back into alignment.
- **Gluon exchange:** Phase errors are quantized corrections carried by gluons along the tube; emission/absorption nudges individual quark phases until the net vector closes.
- **Timescale separation:** Phase-lock time along the tube is much shorter than environmental disturbance times, so small kicks are damped before they decohere the color state.
- **Isolation:** Color flux remains confined inside the tube; external interactions see only the color singlet, preventing phase information from leaking and causing decoherence.

### Why is the Proton Stable?
The Proton ($uud$) consists of two $+2/3$ quarks and one $-1/3$ quark.
*   **Coulomb Repulsion:** The two $u$ quarks repel electrically.
*   **Strong Attraction:** The Phase-Locking (Color) forces them to co-rotate in a unified bundle. The "suction" of the vacuum trying to collapse the flux tubes overwhelms the electric repulsion.
*   **Pauli Exclusion:** Since each quark has a different Phase (Color), they are distinguishable quantum states, allowing them to occupy the same spatial ground state.

## Gauge Group Coverage: SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)

The full SM gauge group is captured geometrically as:

- **SU(3) (Color):** azimuthal phase of the personality asymmetry (Red, Green, Blue). Quarks carry a rotating dipole/quadrupole that fixes their SU(3) orientation; leptons are azimuthally symmetric (singlets). Gluons are planar phase-correction ribbons that live on flux tubes and form the octet.
- **SU(2) (Weak isospin):** polarity of the **Active Triad** (three exposed decoration sites). Left-handed fermions are doublets; right-handed fermions are singlets (Active Triad hidden).
- **U(1) (Hypercharge):** net charge of the **Shielded Triad** (three hidden sites) plus core offset; mixes with $T_3$ to give electric charge via $Q = T_3 + Y/2$.
- **Electromagnetism (U(1)
_EM):** photon is the post-mixing corridor; $W^\pm$ and $Z$ are the chiral corridors moving Active-Triad charge/phase (see assemblies/bosons/electroweak-bosons.md).

### Representation cheat sheet (Gen I fermions)

| Field | SU(3) | SU(2) | $Y$ | $Q = T_3 + Y/2$ | Geometric handle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $q_L = (u_L, d_L)$ | 3 | 2 | +1/3 | $(+2/3, -1/3)$ | Active Triad P- or E-dominant on quark core; azimuthal phase sets color |
| $u_R$ | 3 | 1 | +4/3 | +2/3 | Active Triad hidden; asymmetry 5P/1E fixes $Q$ |
| $d_R$ | 3 | 1 | -2/3 | -1/3 | Active Triad hidden; asymmetry 2P/4E |
| $\ell_L = (\nu_L, e_L)$ | 1 | 2 | -1 | $(0, -1)$ | Active Triad P vs E on lepton core; azimuthal symmetry (colorless) |
| $e_R$ | 1 | 1 | -2 | -1 | Active Triad hidden; personality 6E |
| (optional) $\nu_R$ | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | Not present in current architecture; would be symmetric/hidden Active Triad |

### Gauge boson summary

- **Gluons (8):** phase-transfer ribbons on flux tubes; adjoint of SU(3), no net decoration charge.
- **$W^\pm$, $Z$:** transient recoupling corridors moving Active-Triad charge/phase between assemblies (spin-1, weak SU(2) triplet).
- **$B_\mu$ (hypercharge):** corridor tracking Shielded-Triad charge; mixes with $W^3$ to yield photon and $Z$.
- **Photon:** mixed corridor aligned to leave Shielded + Active-Triad combination invariant ($Q$-coupling only).

### Hypercharge bookkeeping (Shielded triad → $Y$)

Hypercharge is set by the net charge on the **Shielded Triad** (three hidden decoration sites) plus any core offset; with $Y = 2(Q - T_3)$ this reduces to $Y = 2\,Q_{\text{shielded}}/e$ for the fermions below.

| Field | Shielded triad charge (e units) | $Y$ from shielded charge | SM $Y$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $q_L = (u_L,d_L)$ | $+1/6$ (2P,1E) | $2 \times (+1/6) = +1/3$ | $+1/3$ |
| $u_R$ | $+1/6$ | $2 \times (+1/6) = +1/3$, then $T_3=0 \Rightarrow Y=2Q=+4/3$ | $+4/3$ |
| $d_R$ | $+1/6$ | $2 \times (+1/6) = +1/3$, then $T_3=0 \Rightarrow Y=2Q=-2/3$ | $-2/3$ |
| $\ell_L = (\nu_L,e_L)$ | $-1/2$ (3E) | $2 \times (-1/2) = -1$ | $-1$ |
| $e_R$ | $-1/2$ | $2 \times (-1/2) = -1$, then $T_3=0 \Rightarrow Y=2Q=-2$ | $-2$ |
| (optional) $\nu_R$ | $-1/2$ | $2 \times (-1/2) = -1$, but if $Q=0, T_3=0 \Rightarrow Y=0$ (requires model choice) | (not in SM) |

Notes: the shielded charge is common within a doublet; right-handed singlets set $Y$ via $Q$ with $T_3=0$.

### Charge quantization cross-check

Because every fermion personality fills six sites with $\pm e/6$, the only stable net charges from the Active+Shielded split are $0, \pm 1/3, \pm 2/3, \pm 1$, matching the SM spectrum (see the e/6 table in phenomenology/gauge-structure-emergence.md Quantization from Stability).

### Right-handed neutrino stance and mass eigenstates

- **Current stance:** We do **not** include a $\nu_R$ in the minimal architecture. Left-handed neutrinos are the only active SU(2) doublet partners; omitting $\nu_R$ preserves the usual anomaly cancellation pattern.
- **If added:** A $\nu_R$ would be a colorless, SU(2)-singlet, $Y=0$ core with shielded/active triads fully symmetric; it would couple only via mixing terms (Dirac/Majorana choice left open).
- **Mass eigenstates:** The neutrino assembly is taken to be metastable; continual micro reconfiguration exposes its three nearby mass eigenstates, giving oscillations. Other fermions have much stiffer cores (full or partly shielded binaries) so their mass eigenstates are effectively fixed; observed mixing (CKM) is then a basis rotation, not time-domain oscillation of a single assembly.
- **CKM view:** Each quark flavor sits in one of three geometric mass eigenstates (set by core shielding/exposure and decoration pattern). The CKM matrix is the rotation between these mass eigenstates and the weak-interaction (Active-Triad) eigenbasis. In weak transitions (e.g., $d \to u$ via $W$), the corridor couples to the weak basis; amplitudes for landing in each mass eigenstate of the outgoing/product quark are weighted by the CKM elements (reactants → products, chemistry style).

## The Generation Mechanism (Mass Hierarchy)

Generations are defined by the **shedding of shielding binaries** from the Nucleus. The Personality Layer (Charge) remains constant.

### Generation II (Muon, Charm, Strange)
*   **Architecture:** Missing the **Outer Binary**.
*   **Nucleus:** **Bi-Binary** (Inner, Middle).
    *   Composition: 2P, 2E (4 architrinos).
*   **Personality:** 6 decorations (unchanged).
*   **Physics:** Without the outer binary shell, the high-energy inner binaries are more "exposed" to the Noether Sea, creating higher drag/interaction (Mass).
*   **Example: The Muon ($\mu^-$)**
    *   Nucleus: Pro-Bi-Binary (4 architrinos).
    *   Personality: 6E.
    *   Total Count: 10 Architrinos.

### Generation III (Tau, Top, Bottom)
*   **Architecture:** Missing **Outer and Middle Binaries**.
*   **Nucleus:** **Uni-Binary** (Inner only).
    *   Composition: 1P, 1E (2 architrinos).
    *   *Note:* This is the bare high-energy engine, extremely unstable/reactive.
*   **Personality:** 6 decorations (unchanged).
*   **Physics:** Maximal exposure of the maximum-curvature regime. Highest Mass. Shortest lifetime.
*   **Example: The Top Quark ($t$)**
    *   Nucleus: Pro-Uni-Binary (2 architrinos).
    *   Personality: 5P, 1E.
    *   Total Count: 8 Architrinos.

### Core Depletion, Axial Vortices, and Lifetime (plain view)

- **What the binaries do:** Each binary carries a pair of axial vortices—think of them as rails that hold the six personality charges in place and share load into the Noether Sea.
- **Gen I (tri-binary):** Three binaries = three vortex pairs → a stiff 3D scaffold that locks the decorations and spreads stress. Long-lived.
- **Gen II (bi-binary):** One binary removed → one vortex pair gone. The remaining scaffold is weaker, so small perturbations kick the core off its attractor more easily. Lifetime drops.
- **Gen III (uni-binary):** Only one binary → a single vortex pair must hold all six charges. Stability margin is tiny; modest hits can reconfigure or eject decorations. Very short-lived.
- **Takeaway:** Fewer binaries → fewer vortex rails → weaker topological confinement → faster decay.

## Phenomenological Implications

### Universality of Gauge Couplings
Because the **Personality Layer** (which dictates charge and isospin) is structurally identical across generations (always 6 sites), the electromagnetic and weak couplings are identical for $e, \mu, \tau$. This elegantly explains Lepton Universality.

### The Proton vs. Neutron
Baryons are bound states of 3 quarks held together by shared flux/gluon planar assemblies.

*   **Proton ($uud$):**
    *   3 Pro-Cores (Gen I).
    *   Decorations: $(5P,1E) + (5P,1E) + (2P,4E)$.
    *   Total Decoration P: $5+5+2 = 12$.
    *   Total Decoration E: $1+1+4 = 6$.
    *   Net: $+6\epsilon = +1e$.
    *   Total Architrinos: $3 \times 6 \text{ (Cores)} + 18 \text{ (Dec)} = 36$.

*   **Neutron ($udd$):**
    *   3 Pro-Cores (Gen I).
    *   Decorations: $(5P,1E) + (2P,4E) + (2P,4E)$.
    *   Total Decoration P: $5+2+2 = 9$.
    *   Total Decoration E: $1+4+4 = 9$.
    *   Net: $0$.
    *   Total Architrinos: 36.

### Decay Pathways
*   **Muon Decay ($\mu^- \to e^- + \bar{\nu}_e + \nu_\mu$):**
    *   This represents the **regrowth** or **capture** of an Outer Binary by the Muon's Bi-binary core to become an Electron (Tri-binary core), shedding energy (neutrinos).
    *   *Alternative View:* The Muon core is unstable and breaks down? No, usually decay goes High Mass -> Low Mass. The Muon (high mass, exposed) must *acquire* shielding (lower mass, stable) from the Noether Sea to become an Electron. This implies decay is an interaction with the vacuum density.

## Summary: The Geometric Dictionary

This table consolidates the mapping between Abstract Standard Model Quantum Numbers and Concrete Architrino Assembly Geometry.

| Quantum Number | Symbol | Standard Model Definition | Architrino Geometric Definition |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Electric Charge** | $Q$ | Coupling strength to the Photon ($\gamma$). | **Net Decoration Count.** Sum of Positrinos ($+e/6$) and Electrinos ($-e/6$) in the Personality Layer. $Q = \sum P - \sum E$. |
| **Weak Isospin** | $T_3$ | Coupling to $W^\pm$ bosons; transforms doublets. | **Polarity of the Active Triad.** The net charge state of the 3 "exposed" decoration sites. (+1/2 = P-dominant, -1/2 = E-dominant). |
| **Weak Hypercharge** | $Y_W$ | $Y_W = 2(Q - T_3)$. | **Charge of the Shielded Triad.** The net charge of the 3 "hidden" decoration sites plus any core offset. |
| **Color Charge** | $C$ | Strong Force charge (Red, Green, Blue). | **Azimuthal Phase Phase.** The angular orientation ($0^\circ, 120^\circ, 240^\circ$) of the decoration asymmetry relative to the nuclear spin axis. |
| **Spin** | $J$ | Intrinsic angular momentum ($1/2\hbar$). | **Core Topology.** The ellipsoidal rotation path of the Tri-binary nucleus. Fermions are spin-1/2 because the path requires 720 degrees to return to the initial state (spinor behavior). |
| **Chirality** | $L/R$ | Handedness (projection of spin on momentum). | **Active Triad Exposure.** <br>• **Left ($L$):** Spin/Momentum alignment exposes the Active Triad to the vacuum (Interaction allowed).<br>• **Right ($R$):** Spin/Momentum alignment rotates the Active Triad into the particle's "wake" or shield (Interaction blocked). |
| **Generation** | I, II, III | Mass hierarchy (Flavor). | **Core Shielding Level.**<br>• **Gen I:** Tri-Binary (Full Shielding).<br>• **Gen II:** Bi-Binary (Partial Shielding).<br>• **Gen III:** Uni-Binary (Exposed Core). |
| **Baryon/Lepton No.** | $B, L$ | Conserved matter counts. | **Core Count.**<br>• **Matter (+1):** Pro-Core (Left-braided nucleus).<br>• **Antimatter (-1):** Anti-Core (Right-braided nucleus). |

For the **Elementary Fermions** (Quarks and Leptons), yes, this table is complete. It covers the "ID Card" required to distinguish every particle in the Standard Model Lagrangian.

### Spin and the 4π rule (geometric reason)

- The tri-binary core has three non-coplanar binary planes with ordered normals; keeping total $\mathbf{J}$ fixed, that ordered triad lives on $SO(3)$ but carries an **ordering/phase sign** from the vortex scaffold.
- A 2π spatial rotation permutes the braid ordering once, flipping the sign of the internal phase (like rotating a framed triad or belt). Only after 4π does the ordered triad and its vortex phase return to the same configuration.
- This ordered-triad + fixed-$\mathbf{J}$ constraint is the geometric origin of the SU(2) double cover → spin-1/2 behavior.

However, there are two nuances we should be aware of, though we don't necessarily need a new row for them:

1.  **Flavor Quantum Numbers ($S, C, B, T$):**
    *   In physics textbooks, you'll see numbers for **Strangeness**, **Charm**, **Bottomness**, and **Topness**.
    *   **Our Mapping:** These are redundant. They are fully covered by the **Generation** row combined with the **Charge** row.
        *   *Example:* "Strangeness = -1" is just code for "Generation II, Charge -1/3 (Down-type)".
        *   Our geometric explanation (Generation = Shielding Level) is actually *better* because it explains *why* Flavor is conserved in Strong interactions (you can't just "shed" a binary ring without a Weak event).

2.  **Intrinsic Parity ($P$):**
    *   By convention, quarks have parity $P = +1$ and antiquarks have $P = -1$.
    *   **Our Mapping:** This is covered by the **Baryon/Lepton Number (Core Topology)** row.
        *   Pro-Core (Matter) = $+$.
        *   Anti-Core (Antimatter) = $-$.
    *   So, we have this covered implicitly.

**Verdict:**
The table is sufficient. It connects the geometry to every parameter needed to calculate a scattering amplitude or a decay rate (except for Mass, which is a derived energy scale, not a quantum number).
