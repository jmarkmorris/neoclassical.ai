# Electroweak Bosons: Photons, W/Z, and Higgs

**Scope:** Defines the geometric assemblies corresponding to the U(1), SU(2), and Scalar sectors.
**Core Principle:** Bosons are discrete, propagating assemblies of architrinos (Planar Tri-binaries) organized into phase-locked corridors.

## The Photon ($\gamma$): Coaxial Contra-Rotating Stack

The Photon is the fundamental carrier of the electromagnetic interaction. Unlike Standard Model QFT, which posits a pre-existing gauge field ($A_\mu$), this framework derives the photon as a **propagating assembly of discrete action history**.

### Ontological Status: No Separate Gauge Inventory
*   **The Claim:** There is no abstract "electromagnetic field" separate from the particles.
*   **The Reality:** The "field" is simply the aggregate path-history of constituent architrinos.
*   **The Assembly:** A photon is a specific, coherent bundle of these historical influences (per-hit actions) organized into a stable geometric corridor. Emission is not the excitation of a background field; it is the **release** of internal architrino sub-assemblies from a source.

### Geometric Unit: The Contra-Rotating Pair
At the finest scale, the photon unit is a composite assembly:
*   **Planar Tri-Binaries:** Unlike spherical fermions, the constituents are 2D (flattened) tri-binaries.
*   **The Sandwich:** Two of these planar disks are stacked **Coaxially** (sharing the propagation axis $\hat{\mathbf{e}}$).
*   **Dynamics:** They are **Contra-Rotating** (Clockwise / Counter-Clockwise).
*   **Neutrality:** This cancellation ensures zero net static charge, leaving only the transverse oscillating field.

### Propagation: The "Photon Train"
A photon manifests as a **Phase-Locked Corridor** of delayed actions.
*   **The Corridor:** A quasi-cylindrical tube aligned with $\hat{\mathbf{e}}$ carrying the superposed $1/r^2$ wake surfaces.
*   **Burst vs. Continuous:**
    *   **Packet (Particle-like):** A discrete atomic transition releases a short "burst" train—a finite segment of the corridor.
    *   **Beam (Classical-like):** A continuous drive (antenna) releases a continuous stream of units, creating a long-range coherent beam.
*   **Group Velocity:** The planar (edge-on) orientation minimizes interaction with the vacuum lattice, allowing propagation at the field speed limit ($v \approx 1$).

### Interaction Rules: Capture and Release
*   **Emission (Corridor Release):** Driven by accelerated motion in the source binary. The internal binding is overcome, and a "stack" of planar wakes is shed along a tangential vector.
*   **Absorption (Corridor Capture):**
    *   Absorption is not the annihilation of a quantum field operator.
    *   It is the **mechanical re-capture** of the corridor by an internal binary in the target atom.
    *   The "Train" docks with the binary, transferring its angular momentum and re-binding the architrinos into the target's mass/energy inventory.

### Environmental Coupling (The Aether)
*   **Spacetime Aether:** The vacuum is populated by neutral assemblies (Noether Cores).
*   **Attenuation & Refraction:**
    *   As the photon train passes through regions of varying density (dielectric media or dense Aether), the corridor **re-couples** transiently with ambient assemblies.
    *   **Refraction:** This drag slows the phase velocity ($v_{phase} < c$).
    *   **Attenuation:** Incoherent scattering can "strip" units off the train, depleting the beam energy over distance (scattering) or absorbing it entirely (opacity).

### Phenomenology
*   **Energy-Frequency:** For a periodic source $\omega$, the flux of architrino hits along the corridor scales as $E_{app} \propto \omega$.
*   **Malus' Law:** Emerges as the geometric projection of the transverse corridor width onto the analyzer's acceptance slot ($I \propto \cos^2 \theta$).

## The Weak Bosons ($W^\pm, Z^0$): Transient Recoupling Bundles

W and Z bosons are not fundamental particles in the sense of eternal objects; they are **localized, short-lived meta-assemblies**—corridors of coupled, high-intensity axial fields that mediate discrete reconfigurations of personality architrinos.

### Concept: The "Thickened" Corridor
*   **Definition:** A W/Z bundle is a compact, phase-locked vortex corridor connecting two polar regions (within or between assemblies).
*   **Composition:** It consists of concentrated **delayed, radial-only actions** arranged to transport charge and angular momentum during a brief interval.
*   **Scale:**
    *   **Spatial Extent ($\ell$):** A few $d_0$ (the minimal binary radius).
    *   **Lifetime ($\tau$):** Impulsive. The bundle exists only long enough to perform the transaction.
*   **Tether vs. Free:**
    *   **Tethered:** In close-range interactions (e.g., within a nucleus), the boson acts as a temporary bridge physically linking the source and destination cores.
    *   **Free Bundle:** In high-energy events, the bundle is "launched" into the vacuum, propagating near the field speed ($v \approx 1$) along its axis before decaying (rupturing) due to internal instability.

### Quantum Numbers and Channels
*   **Spin-1 (Vector):** The corridor possesses a defined axis and transverse phase structure, giving it an effective angular momentum of $1\hbar$.
*   **W Boson ($W^\pm$):**
    *   **Function:** Transports net charge $\pm 6\epsilon$ ($3P \leftrightarrow 3E$ swap).
    *   **Bookkeeping:** The corridor physically moves the "Active Triad" components.
*   **Z Boson ($Z^0$):**
    *   **Function:** Transports energy, momentum, and phase *without* net charge flux.
    *   **Bookkeeping:** A neutral corridor enabling re-phasing and mode exchange.

### Dynamics: Emission and Absorption
*   **The Trigger (Emission):**
    *   Caused by a **Strongly Accelerated Shove** (e.g., a violent binary mode transition).
    *   This kick ejects a "corridor of influence" that nucleates from the superposition of the constituent architrinos' delayed wakes.
*   **Selection Rules (Phase History):**
    *   Coupling is not "magic"; it requires geometric compatibility.
    *   **Chirality:** Allowed couplings follow from the **Path-History Geometry**. The corridor's internal spiral must match the phase structure of the target's nested binaries. "Wrong-handed" targets present a phase mismatch, preventing the tether from locking on.
*   **Absorption:** The corridor is re-captured by a target binary, integrating its payload and updating the target's internal mode energy.

### Effective Mass Scales
*   **Apparent Energy:** The "Mass" ($M_W \approx 80$ GeV, $M_Z \approx 91$ GeV) is not a rest mass of a solid object. It is the **Apparent Confinement Energy** of the corridor at the moment of creation.
*   **Environment Dependence:**
    *   Because it is a dynamic bundle, its effective width (mass) depends on the electromagnetic environment (vacuum density).
    *   **Prediction:** Changing assembly environments (e.g., extreme plasma density) may shift the apparent mass peaks and widths by altering the "tethering stiffness" of the vacuum, without invoking new fields.

## The Higgs Boson ($H$): The Vacuum Breathing Mode

The Higgs is not a propagating assembly *through* the vacuum; it is a resonance *of* the vacuum structure.

### Geometric Structure
*   **The Substrate:** The Noether Sea (vacuum) is a lattice of neutral Tri-Binaries ($1P, 1E$).
*   **Scalar Excitation:** The Higgs is a **Radial Breathing Mode** ($r \to r + \delta r$) of these vacuum units.
*   **Spin-0:** The oscillation is purely radial (scalar), possessing no vector orientation.

### Mass Generation Mechanism
*   **The Cause:** Massive particles (Quarks, W/Z) have complex 3D geometries that do not fit neatly in the lattice interstices.
*   **The Effect:** They physically displace or distort the surrounding vacuum nodes.
*   **The Resistance:** This distortion creates a "tension" field—the resistance of the vacuum tri-binaries to compression. We measure this resistance as **Inertial Mass**.
*   **The Boson:** If you "strike" the vacuum hard enough (e.g., at LHC), you excite this radial ringing mode independently. That resonance is the Higgs Boson ($125$ GeV).

## Pair production (note)

- A neutral Noether Sea cluster (e.g., two neutral cores, 3P/3E each) contains the ingredients for a particle–antiparticle pair. With sufficient energy input (e.g., $\gamma\gamma \to e^+ e^-$), a corridor can unpack that cluster into $e^-$ and $e^+$ while returning the cores to neutrality.
- In photon–photon pair production, the photons supply the energy; the Sea contributes neutral cores, and the six-charge excess arranges into the $\pm e$ decorations of the outgoing pair. Charge and architrino counts stay balanced because the cores are returned neutral.
- Sketch model: energy in → corridor forms using neutral cores + six-charge split → particle + antiparticle → neutral cores relax back to the Sea.
