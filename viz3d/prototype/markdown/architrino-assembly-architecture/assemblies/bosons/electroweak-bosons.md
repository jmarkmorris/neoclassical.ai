##  Photons: Neutral Planar Bundles on a Phase-Locked Corridor (“Photon Train”)

Definition (geometric): A photon is a coherent, charge-neutral, propagating bundle of delayed, purely radial per-hit actions organized along a narrow axial corridor. In practice it appears as a phase-locked stack of planar sub-bundles (“planar bosons on the photon train”) organized by oscillatory constituent architrinos (typically bound in binaries within assemblies). Emission/absorption are re-coupling events among constituent architrinos via internal binaries; no separate gauge-field inventory is required.

- Neutrality and classical character:
  - Net charge is zero at all times; far fields are dominated by transverse oscillations set by path-history geometry. In coherent regimes, photons exhibit classical-beam behavior (“evidence for classical photons”) while retaining packet-like coupling to discrete normal modes.

- Axial corridor geometry:
  - A quasi-cylindrical corridor aligned with propagation axis $\hat{\mathbf{e}}$ carries the superposed $1/r^2$ wake surfaces in a phase structure that self-guides the bundle. The corridor supports a train of phase-aligned planar slices that advance at group speed ~ $v$.

- Polarization, helicity, and Malus:
  - Linear polarization = fixed orientation of the principal transverse oscillation ellipse relative to $\hat{\mathbf{e}}$.
  - Circular/elliptic polarization = constant-phase rotation of that ellipse around $\hat{\mathbf{e}}$; helicity is the sign of this axial phase winding.
  - Malus’s law emerges geometrically: an analyzer projects the corridor’s transverse pattern onto its axis, giving transmitted intensity $\propto \cos^2\theta$ from corridor–analyzer overlap, without invoking right-hand-rule magnetism.

- Kinematics and path:
  - Group velocity ≈ $v$ (1 in our units); no rest frame (apparent rest energy is zero).
  - Energy–frequency correspondence: for a periodic source of angular frequency $\omega$, the apparent energy flux scales $E_{\text{app}} \propto \omega$ over resolved intervals.
  - “Absolute distance and path” correspond to the geometric length of the axial corridor threaded by the train across simultaneity slices $\Sigma_t$.

- Environmental coupling (spacetime æther and media):
  - Refraction, dispersion, and attenuation arise from re-coupling/decoupling between the corridor and coherent ambient assemblies (including spacetime æther assemblies), changing phase velocity or depleting the train.

- Interaction rules (emergent):
  - Coupling is strongest to assemblies with compatible axial corridors (polar regions of binaries/cores).
  - Absorption = corridor re-capture by an internal binary via re-binding of constituent architrinos, increasing mode energy or reconfiguring personality architrinos.
  - Emission = corridor release driven by accelerated constituent architrinos within subassemblies; bursts form short trains, continuous drives form long trains.

Plain language: A photon is a neutral, phase-locked “train” of planar pushes guided down a narrow tube; polarizers simply project that tube’s sideways wiggle (giving cos²$\theta$), and making or absorbing a photon is the tube locking onto or peeling off an internal rotating pair.

# W and Z Bosons as Transient Electroweak Meta-Assemblies

We work in units with field speed $v=1$ unless stated otherwise. $\epsilon = |e|/6$ is the unit charge magnitude.

## 1) Concept: Localized Recoupling Bundles

In this framework, W± and Z⁰ are not fundamental particles; they are short-lived, localized meta-assemblies—corridors of coupled, high-intensity axial field that mediate discrete reconfigurations of personality architrinos between Noether Core assemblies.

- Corridor geometry:
  - A W/Z bundle is a compact, phase-locked vortex corridor connecting two polar regions (within or between assemblies). It carries concentrated delayed, radial-only actions arranged to transport charge and/or angular momentum during a brief interval.
- Lifetime and scale:
  - Spatial extent $\ell$ is a few $d_0$ (the minimal binary radius); lifetime $\tau$ is short (impulsive on assembly timescales). The bundle typically propagates near $v$ along its axis when emitted into open space, or remains tethered between sources during transfer.

Plain language: W and Z are fleeting “thickened tubes” of push that briefly connect two poles to swap charge or spin before they fade.

## 2) Channels and Quantum Numbers

- W± (charged transfer):
  - Function: transports net charge $\pm 6\epsilon$ between assemblies by reconfiguring which cores/personality architrinos carry those $\epsilon$-units.
  - Charge: $q_W = \pm 6\epsilon$ (matches $\pm e$ when measured in electron units).
  - Spin: effectively spin-1 from the axial corridor structure and its transverse phase.
  - Interpretation: a localized transfer operation that updates the charge bookkeeping of the coupled assemblies while conserving the global $\epsilon$-inventory.

- Z⁰ (neutral transfer):
  - Function: transports energy, momentum, and angular momentum with zero net charge.
  - Charge: $q_Z = 0$.
  - Spin: effectively spin-1 for the same axial reasons.
  - Interpretation: a neutral corridor enabling re-phasing and mode exchange without charge movement.

Conservation: All transfers are implemented as reassignment of personality architrinos among cores and changes in internal mode energies; global sums of ±$\epsilon$ and total energy are conserved by construction.

## 3) Emission and Absorption (Geometric Rules)

- Emission:
  - Triggered by strongly accelerated, asymmetric internal motion near a polar region (e.g., binary mode transitions). A corridor nucleates from the superposition of constituent architrinos’ delayed radial pushes that add coherently along an axis and then either tethers to a nearby target or departs as a free bundle.
- Absorption:
  - Occurs when a corridor aligns with a compatible polar region; the phase-locked pattern is re-captured via constituent architrino re-binding, yielding a discrete update of bound personality architrinos and internal mode energies.
- Selection rules:
  - Axial and chiral compatibility determine W vs Z channel availability and polarization. Right-hand-rule constructs do not appear; allowed/forbidden couplings follow from path-history geometry and the phase structure of the nested binaries.

Plain language: A sharp internal shove at a pole can launch a tube; if another pole of the right shape and timing is waiting, the tube docks and hands off charge or spin; if not, it decays in flight.

## 4) Effective Mass Scales (Apparent)

These bundles are localized and energetic; their “masses” in scattering experiments are apparent energy scales of the corridor at emission/absorption (confinement energy of the bundle), not rest masses of fundamental particles. Apparent mass peaks thus reflect the typical mode energies and lifetimes of the corridor in a given environment.

Prediction handle: Changing assembly environments (mode spectra, polarization statistics, corridor length scales) shifts apparent widths and branching tendencies without invoking new fundamental fields.

# Higgs Boson as a Scalar-Like Meta-Assembly (Working Hypothesis)

We work in units with field speed $v=1$.

## Purpose
Outline a minimal, testable hypothesis for a Higgs-like phenomenon within the neoclassical, delayed radial-action framework.
