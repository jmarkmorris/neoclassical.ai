# Assembly Atlas (Stub)

This atlas enumerates stable and metastable assemblies and summarizes their defining dynamical regimes.

## Core Taxonomy

- **Binary**: Opposite-charge pair; spirals inward and stabilizes at maximal curvature via self-hit when $v>c_f$.
- **Tri-binary (Noether core)**: Three nested binaries with **energy-separated** radii/frequencies in low-energy conditions, with orbital planes tending toward near-orthogonality:
  - **Inner**: maximal curvature, self-hit regime ($v>c_f$).
  - **Middle**: **always** at field speed ($v=c_f$), with **variable radius/frequency**; acts as the **energy-storage fulcrum**.
  - **Outer**: sub-field-speed ($v<c_f$); expansion/contraction modes and medium coupling.

## Planck-Scale Framing

In this framework, **Planck-scale** references are tied to an **event-horizon alignment condition**, not to the inner binary's maximal-curvature radius. At alignment, the **middle and outer binaries reach $v=c_f$ and become coplanar and co-linear with the inner binary**, with precession ceasing.
