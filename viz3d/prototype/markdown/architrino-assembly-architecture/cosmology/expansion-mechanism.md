### Cosmological Expansion in the Euclidean Void

1. **The Scale Factor ($a(t)$)**: Expansion is **not** the stretching of space. The $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective sees the $(x,y,z)$ coordinates remain fixed.
2. **Expansion Mechanism**: Expansion is the statistical increase in the separation of Noether cores or the "scaling up" of the Tri-Binary radius over absolute time.
3. **Redshift**: Photons (assemblies) lose internal frequency as they travel because they are coupling to a background Noether Sea that is itself scaling or changing density over time.
4. **$H_0$ Tension**: Variations in the local density of the Noether Sea (voids vs. filaments) lead to different effective scaling rates, naturally explaining $H_0$ discrepancies.


### Expansion as Scaling, Not Stretching

1. **Fixed Background**: The Euclidean Void does **not** expand.
2. **Assembly Scaling**: "Cosmic Expansion" is the statistical growth of the radius of the **Outer Binary** of vacuum assemblies over absolute time $t$.
3. **Redshift**: Photons (tri-binaries) traveling through a scaling medium undergo frequency decay. The $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective sees the photon "growing" and "slowing."
4. **Cosmic Time**: FRW "Cosmic Time" is an approximation of absolute time $t$, reconstructed from the behavior of comoving assembly clocks.


### Expansion via Scaling

* **Fixed Void:** The Euclidean grid does *not* expand.
* **Scaling:** Cosmic expansion is the uniform growth of the Outer Binary radius of the vacuum assemblies (Noether cores) over absolute time.
* **Redshift:** Photons (assemblies) "grow" (wavelength increases) and "slow" (frequency drops) as they traverse the scaling medium.
* **H0 Tension:** Local variations in vacuum density (voids vs. clusters) affect the local scaling rate.


### Expansion of the Universe: Scaling in a Fixed Euclidean Void

#### Absolute vs. Emergent Notions of Expansion

- **Absolute substrate**:
  - The Euclidean void (coordinates $(x,y,z)$) does **not expand**.
  - Distances between points in the void are fixed geometrically.
- **What “expands”**:
  - The configuration of the **Noether-core sea** (spacetime medium),
  - Characteristic scales of tri-binary assemblies and their separations.

From the $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective:

- There is an evolving spatial pattern of assemblies:
  - Typical inter-core spacing $L_{\text{core}}(t)$,
  - Typical outer-binary radii $R_{\text{outer}}(t)$,
  both functions of absolute time t.

#### Effective Scale Factor

We define an **effective scale factor** $a(t)$ as:

$a(t) \propto \frac{\langle L_{\text{core}}(t) \rangle}{\langle L_{\text{core}}(t_{\text{ref}}) \rangle}$

or, equivalently, using some other robust medium-scale measure (e.g. average separation of bound assemblies in comoving patches).

- This $a(t)$ is **not** stretching the void; it describes:
  - How the spatial distribution of the medium and matter assemblies evolves *within* the fixed void.
- Physical FRW coordinates are then an emergent reparameterization:
  - Comoving coordinates follow the motion of the medium relative to the void.
  - Comoving time ≈ proper time of a congruence of “cosmic rest” tri-binary clocks.

#### Redshift Mechanism

In this picture, cosmological redshift arises because:

- Photons are tri-binary (planar) assemblies propagating through an evolving medium.
- As they traverse the Noether-core sea:
  - Their internal frequencies and effective wavelengths change in response to the scaling of outer-binary lengths and medium density.
- From the $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective:
  - Photon paths are straight lines in $(x,y,z)$ with time-varying internal frequency $\nu(t)$ and effective propagation characteristics due to the time-dependent medium.
- From physical observers:
  - Redshift $1+z = a_{\text{obs}}/a_{\text{emit}}$ emerges as in FRW cosmology.

A core task here is to:

- Connect the microphysical scaling of tri-binary structures + medium evolution to:
  - An effective scale factor $a(t)$,
  - The standard redshift–distance relation.

#### H₀ Tension Perspective

Because the medium is not homogeneous at all scales:

- Local variations in Noether-core density and dynamics may cause:
  - Different apparent expansion rates inferred from:
    - Early universe probes (CMB, BAO),
    - Late-time, local probes (SNe Ia, strong lensing).
- This opens the possibility that the **H₀ tension** is:
  - A manifestation of inhomogeneous medium properties in a fixed void, rather than a failure of $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ per se.

We should aim to:

- Formulate a toy model where:
  - Regions of different medium density have slightly different effective $a(t)$ histories,
  - Yet all evolve in the same absolute time t in the void.
- Check whether such a model can produce:
  - H₀(CMB) ≈ 67 km/s/Mpc,
  - H₀(local) ≈ 73 km/s/Mpc,
  without violating other cosmological constraints.
