## Simulation Frame: Implementing the Virtual/$\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective View

- All tiers are implemented in the absolute Euclidean frame (fixed x,y,z; absolute t).
- The simulator effectively plays the role of the $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective by integrating the master equation and maintaining S(t).
- Raw outputs are $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$-style (fields, provenance, microstate summaries).
- “What experiments see” is generated by post-processing: embed detector assemblies with worldlines X_det(t), compute $\tau$_det(t), and generate detector-like logs.

Checklist per tier:
- What $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ records ($\Phi$, ∇$\Phi$, medium vars, provenance)
- How to compute physical observables ($\tau$, redshift, lensing proxies, GW strain proxies)
- Convergence requirements for each output type


### Simulation Frame and the $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective

All simulation tiers are implemented in the absolute frame:

- **Spatial frame:** fixed Cartesian grid in the Euclidean void, $(x,y,z)$ constant in time.
- **Temporal frame:** global absolute time $t$, advanced in discrete steps $\Delta t$.
- **Microdynamics:** architrino positions and velocities updated according to the master equation; potentials propagated at speed $c_f$.

From the code’s perspective, we are always the **$\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective**:

- We know $S(t)$ (all architrinos, all assemblies) at each time step.
- We can compute fields and medium state anywhere in the domain.

To connect to experiment:

- We embed **model detectors** (assembly worldlines) in this frame.
- We compute:
  - What fields they experience along their paths,
  - How their internal clocks tick ($\tau$ vs t),
  - What signals they register (arrival times, redshifts, intensity patterns).
- Synthetic observables are derived from these detector responses, not from raw $S(t)$ directly.

This enforces a clean separation between:

- Fundamental dynamics in the absolute frame (what the simulation integrates),
- Emergent observational physics (what real experiments would see).
