## $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective ($\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$) / $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective Logging Standard (Tier-agnostic)

### Purpose
Define a canonical $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective ($\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$) used across all simulation tiers for logging, diagnostics, and synthetic datasets. $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ is not physically realizable; it is a bookkeeping operator acting on the full microstate.

### Definition
A $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ is defined by:
- Fixed Euclidean sample points or worldlines P = {x_k} in R^3
- Access to the full state S(t) = {(x_i(t), v_i(t), q_i, ...)} for all architrinos
- Output channels:
  - Local potential $\Phi$(x\_k,t)
  - Local gradient ∇$\Phi$(x\_k,t) (force proxy)
  - Optional local medium state variables for Noether-core sea (e.g., $\rho$\_core, alignment/orientation metrics)
  - Causal wake surface provenance/event tags: for each received contribution at (x\_k,t), record (emitter\_id, emission\_time t\_emit) satisfying |x\_k − x\_emitter(t\_emit)| = c\_f (t − t\_emit)

### Minimal synthetic products
- Time series: $\Phi$(t), ∇$\Phi$(t) at fixed points (“stationary detectors”)
- Snapshot field maps: $\Phi$(x,t0), ∇$\Phi$(x,t0) over grids at fixed t0
- Provenance tables: (receiver_id, t, emitter_id, t_emit, contribution_strength)
- Propagation diagnostics: arrival-time distributions, dispersion tests, effective c_eff estimates

### Mapping: $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ data → Physical observables
Synthetic observables must be generated by post-processing $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ logs with a model of a *physical* observer (assembly clock/detector):
1) Extract local medium state along detector worldline X_det(t)
2) Compute proper time $\tau$_det via d$\tau$ = F(medium_state, v_det, $\Phi$, ∇$\Phi$, …) dt (from proper-time-derivation.md)
3) Generate detector-like outputs:
   - clock readings $\tau$(t)
   - photon arrival times and frequency shifts
   - inferred “geodesics” (effective paths) from travel-time minimization in variable c_eff/medium

### Validation checks (must pass)
- Causality/provenance: all recorded contributions satisfy t_emit ≤ t and solve |x_k − x_i(t_emit)| = c_f (t − t_emit) within tolerance.
- Cross-integrator invariance: $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ logs agree within uncertainty across at least two integrators.
- Convergence: $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ observables converge under:
  - $\Delta$t refinement
  - history-resolution refinement (emission-time inversion/interpolation)
  - spatial resolution refinement (grid / particle resolution)

### Failure mode
If $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ logging shows integrator-dependent provenance (different t\_emit solutions or qualitatively different self-hit event counts under refinement), treat results as numerically unreliable in self-hit regimes until resolved.


### Absolute (Virtual) Observer as Standard Probe

1. **Definition**: A $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective ($\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$) is a non-physical bookkeeping operator acting on the full microstate $S(t)$.
2. **Synthetic Observables**:
    - **Raw Data**: Time series of $\Phi(x,t)$ at fixed points.
    - **Post-Processing**: To simulate a physical detector, we act on the raw data by integrating the proper time $\tau$ of a "clock assembly" moving through the $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ grid.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: This explicitly separates Ontology (simulation state/$\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ data) from Phenomenology (synthetic detector data).


### Virtual Sensor & Data Extraction

* **Virtual Sensor:** Implementation of the $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective. Samples potential/gradient at fixed coordinates.
* **Post-Processing:** Convert Virtual Sensor data (Ground Truth) into Physical Observer data (what a moving clock measures).
* **Provenance:** Track emitter ID and emission time for every potential contribution at a grid point.
