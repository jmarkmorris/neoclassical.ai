# Delay-Only Formulations (Exact Statements)

Purpose:
- State the delay differential equations (DDEs) that govern canonical interactions under the delayed, purely radial law.
- Record exact analytical solutions only where they exist; otherwise, state solvability status without approximations.

Models:
- Fixed center (test particle, source stationary):
  - DDE reduces exactly to the ODE $\ddot{r}=-K/r^2$ with $K=\kappa |q q'|>0$; exact closed forms exist.
- Two-body mutual interaction (opposite or equal charges):
  - Coupled DDEs with causal roots $t_0$ defined by $|x_i(t)-x_j(t_0)|=t-t_0$ (v=1); accelerations superpose as $\pm \kappa \epsilon^2/r^2$ along the line of action.
  - No exact closed-form solutions are presently known for the coupled DDEs in general.

Symmetric two-body on a line (exact DDE; challenges):
- Let $x_1(t)=+\tfrac{1}{2}r(t)$ and $x_2(t)=-\tfrac{1}{2}r(t)$ with $r(t)>0$ and $v=1$. The causal-time condition implies
  $$
  \frac{r(t)+r(t_0)}{2} \;=\; t - t_0,\qquad t_0<t,
  $$
  or, writing $\tau(t)=t-t_0>0$ implicitly,
  $$
  r(t) + r\!\big(t-\tau(t)\big) \;=\; 2\,\tau(t).
  $$
- For opposite charges, the exact relative-coordinate equation is the state-dependent DDE
  $$
  \ddot r(t) \;=\; -\,\frac{8\,\kappa\,\epsilon^2}{\big(r(t) + r(t-\tau(t))\big)^2},
  $$
  with $\tau(t)$ determined by the implicit constraint above. For equal charges, the sign is reversed.

Integral (delta) form selecting the causal root:
- For particle 1 one may write
  $$
  a_1(t) \;=\; -\,\kappa\,\epsilon^2 \int_{0}^{\infty}
  \frac{\delta\!\big(\lvert x_1(t)-x_2(t-\tau)\rvert - \tau\big)\,
  \mathrm{sgn}\!\big(x_1(t)-x_2(t-\tau)\big)}
  {\lvert x_1(t)-x_2(t-\tau)\rvert^{2}}\; d\tau,
  $$
  whose evaluation reduces exactly to finding the causal delay $\tau(t)$; in the symmetric 1D case this yields the DDE above.

Why closed-form solutions are unlikely (even with symmetry):
- The delay is state-dependent: the unknown $r(t)$ appears both in the right-hand side and in the implicit constraint defining $\tau(t)$, making the problem a nonlinear functional equation rather than an ODE.
- Even linear constant-delay DDEs rarely admit elementary closed forms; state-dependent delays are generically non-integrable. The fixed-center problem is a special case that collapses to an ODE (see 00.2.3.1).

Solution techniques (toolbox for delayed, radial DDEs):
- Method of steps (constant delays): for problems with fixed delay $\tau$ and a given history $x(t)=\phi(t)$ on $t\in[-\tau,0]$, integrate an ODE on successive intervals, using the known past segment on each step.
- State-dependent delay root-tracking: treat $\tau(t)$ as an algebraic unknown constrained by the causal-time equation (e.g., $r(t)+r(t-\tau)=2\tau$). On each step, solve the coupled system with a Newton corrector for $\tau(t)$; ensures consistency of the delay with the evolving state.
- Collocation / implicit Runge–Kutta with history interpolation: represent the recent history by Hermite/spline polynomials; at each step solve stage equations together with the causal constraint(s), updating a continuous extension of the history.
- Shooting and continuation for periodic motions: pose a boundary-value problem over one period with delay constraints; solve by Newton shooting or collocation and continue solutions via pseudo-arclength. Useful for detecting limit cycles and their stability.
- Spectral-in-time methods: on (quasi-)periodic windows, expand in Fourier/Chebyshev bases; constant delays enter as phase factors, while state-dependent delays are handled by iterating a frozen-delay linearization.
- Stability analysis (qualitative): Lyapunov–Krasovskii and Razumikhin functionals yield sufficient conditions for stability without solving trajectories; applicable to history classes with bounded delays.
- PDE embeddings (transport representation): introduce an auxiliary history field $y(t,\theta)$ on $\theta\in[-\tau_{\max},0]$ with $y_t + y_\theta = 0$ and boundary $y(t,0)=x(t)$; discretize in $\theta$ (method of lines). For state-dependent delays, use a moving boundary; aligns with the project’s radial-transport perspective.
- Green’s-function / hit-integral formulations: write per-hit actions as delta-weighted time integrals selecting causal roots; evaluate by robust root-finding and quadrature. This matches the event-driven law used here.
- Measure-driven/event-driven solvers with mollification: replace surface deltas by narrow Gaussians ($\eta>0$) to obtain $C^1$ trajectories; take $\eta\to 0$ in the weak sense after validating work–energy over resolved windows.
- Linear constant-delay benchmarks: for linear DDEs (e.g., $x' = a x + b x(t-\tau)$) use Laplace transforms/characteristic equations and Lambert W; helpful for validation and step-size/error control, even though the canonical two-body problems here are nonlinear and state-dependent.
- A posteriori error control: use defect/residual of collocation, step halving with history re-interpolation, and event-time error estimates for adaptive step and tolerance selection.
- Fixed-point frameworks: establish local existence/uniqueness by contraction on history spaces $C([-\tau_{\max},0])$ (or their mollified variants); use Picard iterations as a solver preconditioner.

Deliverables:
- Precise DDE forms and causal-root conditions for use in analysis and computation.
- Cross-references to sections with exact solutions (fixed source) and status notes (mutual interaction).

Plain language: We give only the exact delayed equations; where an exact solution exists (fixed source), we present it, and where it does not (mutual interaction), we say so without approximations.
