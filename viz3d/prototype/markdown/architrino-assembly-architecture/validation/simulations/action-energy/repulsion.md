# Equal-Charge Symmetric Repulsion

Setup:
- Two identical charges (e.g., q1=q2=+$\epsilon$) placed at separation r0 with v1=v2=0 and symmetry about the midpoint.

Objectives:
- Delay-only formulation of the equations of motion (DDEs).
- Exact analytic solutions if available; otherwise, status of solvability.

Delay differential equations (two-body, v=1):
- Causal times:
  - $t_0^{(2\to 1)}\in\mathcal{C}_2(t)$ solves $\lvert x_1(t)-x_2(t_0)\rvert = t-t_0$.
  - $t_0^{(1\to 2)}\in\mathcal{C}_1(t)$ solves $\lvert x_2(t)-x_1(t_0)\rvert = t-t_0$.
- Accelerations (sum over all causal roots if multiple exist):
  $$
  a_1(t)
  \;=\;
  \sum_{t_0\in\mathcal{C}_2(t)}
  +\,\kappa\,\epsilon^2\,\frac{\mathrm{sgn}\!\big(x_1(t)-x_2(t_0)\big)}{r_{12}^2},
  \quad
  r_{12}=\big|x_1(t)-x_2(t_0)\big|,
  $$
  $$
  a_2(t)
  \;=\;
  \sum_{t_0\in\mathcal{C}_1(t)}
  -\,\kappa\,\epsilon^2\,\frac{\mathrm{sgn}\!\big(x_2(t)-x_1(t_0)\big)}{r_{21}^2},
  \quad
  r_{21}=\big|x_2(t)-x_1(t_0)\big|.
  $$
- Symmetry implies $x_1(t)=-x_2(t)$ and $a_1(t)=-a_2(t)$ for all $t$ given symmetric initial data.

Solvability status:
- No exact closed-form solution is presently known for the coupled DDE system under mutual repulsion with delay.

Deliverables:
- Exact DDE statements and causal-root definitions suitable for analysis and computation.
- Notes on symmetry and qualitative properties without invoking approximations.

Plain language: Two like charges at rest push apart along the line under the delayed law; the governing equations are implicit in the causal times, and no closed-form solution is currently known.
