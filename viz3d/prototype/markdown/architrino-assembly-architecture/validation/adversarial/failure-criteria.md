## The Lorentzian Conspiracy Stop-Condition

While the $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective is a powerful tool, it introduces a "Hard Wall" for the theory.

1. **The Detection Threshold**: If the absolute frame (the "Ether rest frame") is detectable by any physical experiment (e.g., Michelson-Morley) at a level higher than $\Delta c/c > 10^{-17}$, the theory fails.
2. **Requirement of Conspiracy**: We must provide a rigorous derivation showing that the **forces between architrinos in a moving assembly** contract the assembly in the direction of motion by exactly $\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$ in the absolute frame.
3. **Falsification**: If the tri-binary stability analysis shows that the assembly "breaks" or "distorts" at high absolute velocities in a way that *doesn't* match the Lorentz transformation, the $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective becomes a liability, and the theory must be discarded.


### The Lorentzian Conspiracy Stop-Condition

1. **The Hard Wall**: If the Absolute Frame is detectable by any physical experiment (e.g., Michelson-Morley) at $\Delta c/c > 10^{-17}$, the theory fails.
2. **Required Conspiracy**: We must derive that assembly forces naturally contract dimensions by $\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$ relative to the Absolute Grid.
3. **Vacuum Drag**: If the "Sea of Cores" induces drag that slows cosmological bodies without a counter-mechanism, the theory is falsified.


### Critical Stop Conditions

* **$c_f$ Variance:** If field speed varies in the true void, theory fails.
* **Vacuum Drag:** If "Sea of Cores" causes orbital decay (drag) on planets without a counter-mechanism, theory fails.
* **Lorentz Leakage:** If absolute motion affects atomic spectra > $10^{-17}$, theory fails.
