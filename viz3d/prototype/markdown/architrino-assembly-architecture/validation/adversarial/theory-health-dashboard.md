### Risk: "Aether" Labeling

1. **Flag**: The "Sea of Coupled Noether Cores" + "$\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective" structure is functionally an Aether theory.
2. **Mitigation**: Rigorously define differences from 19th-century Luminiferous Aether (discrete assembly network vs. continuous fluid; $c_f$ dynamics vs. fluid dynamics).
3. **Stop Condition**: If Lorentz suppression requires fine-tuning >5 parameters, the "Naturalness" score drops to Red.


### Terminology Risk

* **Flag:** "Sea of Cores" + "$\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective" reads like 19th-century Aether.
* **Mitigation:** Rigorously define difference: discrete assembly network vs. continuous fluid; $c_f$ dynamics vs. fluid dynamics.
