### Validation Protocols: Proving the Absolute Frame

#### $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective Proxies
* **The CMB Rest Frame:** While the $\mathbb{U}_{\text{now}}$ universe-state perspective is virtual, the CMB dipole-free frame serves as the closest physical approximation to the "Rest Frame of the Noether Sea."
* **Protocol:** Any simulation result must be transformed into the CMB rest frame to check for consistency with large-scale cosmological observations.

#### Null Tests for "Ether Drift"
* **Simulation Protocol:** Run a simulated Michelson-Morley experiment within the Noether Core lattice.
* **Success Criterion:** The interference pattern must remain invariant as the assembly is rotated relative to the absolute Euclidean grid.
* **Mechanism to Verify:** Check that the tri-binary "Noether core" naturally contracts by $\gamma^{-1}$ due to its internal architrino trajectories being compressed by motion through the potential background.

#### Precision Atomic Comparison
* **Protocol:** Compare the predicted shift in the 1S-2S Hydrogen transition for a system moving relative to the absolute grid vs. one at rest.
* **Bounds:** Must match experimental lack of sidereal variation to $< 10^{-16}$.
