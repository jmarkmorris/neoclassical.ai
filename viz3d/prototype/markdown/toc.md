## INDEX

**Notes on Structure:**
- **Three-level hierarchy** as requested: Parts (Roman numerals), Chapters (Arabic numerals), Sections (subsection titles).
- **Flow:** Foundations → Idealized systems → Assembly architecture → Mapping to known physics → Interpretation → Cosmology → Technology/computation → Synthesis.
- **Pedagogical:** Begins with ontology and simple systems, builds complexity, confronts existing theory, addresses objections, and ends with vision and open questions.
- **Comprehensive:** Covers all major assets you listed, organized thematically rather than by file structure.
- **Textbook-ready:** Can be expanded with examples, problem sets, figures, and appendices for a full academic treatment.

This is a **first draft**—we can refine ordering, merge or split chapters, adjust emphasis, or reorganize as needed. Let me know where you'd like to go deeper or restructure.
