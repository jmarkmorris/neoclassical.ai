### Substrate Ontology: The Void, The Vacuum, and the Observer

1. **The Euclidean Void (Ontic Ground)**: The fundamental container is a continuous, rigid 3D Euclidean space ($\mathbb{R}^3$) and a linear, absolute time ($t$). Most coordinate points in the void are unoccupied by architrinos.
2. **The Vacuum (Physical Medium)**: What is traditionally called "vacuum" is actually a dense sea of coupled pro- and anti-architrino tri-binary assemblies (Noether Cores). This "Noether Sea" endows the void with effective properties like permittivity, permeability, and refractive index.
3. **The Absolute Observer (AO)**: A conceptual (non-physical) vantage point that tracks the full microstate—position, velocity, and charge of every architrino at any $(x,y,z,t)$. The AO witnesses the "Path History" (retarded potential) exactly as it was emitted.
4. **The Physical Observer (PO)**: Any observer or detector composed of architrino assemblies. The PO is subject to the dynamics of the medium; their rulers contract and their clocks dilate relative to the AO’s grid.
5. **Simultaneity**: The Absolute Observer witnesses a unique global "Now." Relativity of simultaneity is an epistemic artifact for Physical Observers whose internal signal processing is limited by $c_f$ and modulated by the medium.
6. **Key Distinction**: 
   - **Void**: Empty stage, fixed coordinates, non-dynamical.
   - **Vacuum/Aether**: Physical substance, assembly lattice, dynamical (the "Spacetime Fabric").
