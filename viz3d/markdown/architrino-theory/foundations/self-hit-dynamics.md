### Non-Markovian Memory and the Self-Hit Condition

1. **Self-Hit Definition**: A self-hit occurs when an architrino’s current trajectory $(\mathbf{x}(t))$ intersects the expanding potential sphere emitted by itself at a prior time $t_{hist}$.
2. **Intersection Logic**: In absolute Euclidean coordinates, find $t_{hist}$ such that:
   $$|\mathbf{x}(t) - \mathbf{x}(t_{hist})| = c_f (t - t_{hist})$$
3. **The Stability Mechanism**: Self-hit provides the non-linear "push-back" force required to prevent binary collapse. It replaces the "singularities" of 1/r potential with a high-curvature constraint.
4. **Virtual Observer Diagnostics**: Simulation logs must record self-hit frequency and "provenance" (the age of the shell being hit) to distinguish stable Tri-Binary attractors from chaotic or decaying states.
