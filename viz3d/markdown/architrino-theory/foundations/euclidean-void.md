## The Aether Sea: Noether Core Occupancy

The Absolute Observer reveals that what we perceive as "Empty Space" is actually a dense lattice of neutral assemblies.

1. **Occupancy Density**: Define $\rho_{nc}$ as the number of Noether cores per unit volume of Euclidean void.
2. **Aether Composition**: The "Vacuum" consists of Helium-like couplings (2 pro-architrino tri-binaries + 2 anti-architrino tri-binaries).
3. **Refractive Index of Spacetime**: The "curvature" of GR is remapped as a **variable density gradient** of this aether. An AO sees a photon moving in a straight line through the void, but at a varying speed $c_{eff} < c_f$ due to the density of the aether sea. This removes the need for "curved" coordinates; we use "refractive" coordinates in a flat box.
