### The Case for Absolute Time ($t$)

1. **Fundamental Parameter**: Absolute time $t$ is the unique, universal evolution parameter of the architrino Master Equation. It provides a unique global foliation of the universe.
2. **Virtual Observer Knowledge**: The Virtual (Absolute) Observer indexes the state of all architrinos against $t$, allowing for a single, non-branching history (dissolving Many-Worlds).
3. **Derived Proper Time ($\tau$)**: Proper time is not fundamental; it is a derived functional of the tri-binary clock's motion and its interaction with the local Noether core sea density.
4. **Simultaneity Reclaimed**: In the absolute frame, simultaneity is objective. The "Relativity of Simultaneity" is reinterpreted as a synchronization convention used by assemblies that rely on $c_f$-limited signaling within a moving medium.
