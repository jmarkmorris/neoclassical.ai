### Mass as Drag in the "Sea"

1. **Higgs Mechanism Analog**: Mass is not intrinsic. It is the drag/coupling coefficient of a fermion (ellipsoidal assembly) moving through the Noether Sea.
2. **Chirality**: "Left-handed" vs "Right-handed" geometries interact differently with the polarized potential of the Sea, creating the mass terms.

## Addenda (Phe - supplemental)

### Mass as Vacuum Drag

* **Mechanism:** Mass is the resistance/inertia experienced by a fermion (ellipsoidal assembly) translating through the Sea of Noether Cores.
* **Chirality:** Left/Right geometric asymmetry causes differential coupling to the polarized potential of the Sea.
