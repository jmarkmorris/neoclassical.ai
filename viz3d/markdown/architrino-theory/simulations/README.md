## Simulation Frame: Implementing the Virtual/Absolute Observer View

- All tiers are implemented in the absolute Euclidean frame (fixed x,y,z; absolute t).
- The simulator effectively plays the role of the Virtual Observer by integrating the master equation and maintaining S(t).
- Raw outputs are VO-style (fields, provenance, microstate summaries).
- “What experiments see” is generated by post-processing: embed detector assemblies with worldlines X_det(t), compute τ_det(t), and generate detector-like logs.

Checklist per tier:
- What VO records (Φ, ∇Φ, medium vars, provenance)
- How to compute physical observables (τ, redshift, lensing proxies, GW strain proxies)
- Convergence requirements for each output type
