### Neo-Lorentzian Structure: Ether vs Architrino Substrate

Classical Lorentz ether theory posited:

- A preferred rest frame (ether),
- Dynamical Lorentz contraction and time dilation,
- Ether undetectable due to exact compensation in rods and clocks.

In the architrino framework:

- **Preferred frame**:
  - The Euclidean void + absolute time is the preferred coordinate frame.
  - The virtual (absolute) observer is at rest with respect to this frame.

- **“Ether” content**:
  - The role of ether is played by the sea of coupled Noether cores (tri‑binary assemblies forming the spacetime medium).
  - Unlike 19th‑century ether, its microstructure and dynamics are explicitly specified via architrinos and self‑hit.

- **Lorentz symmetry**:
  - Emerges dynamically from how assemblies deform and clocks slow when moving through the medium.
  - For physical observers, Lorentz invariance is effective: they cannot detect the preferred frame in the tested regimes.

Key differences from historical ether models:

- The substrate is **not an extra substance** distinct from matter; it is built from the same architrinos.
- The preferred frame is **not empirically idle**: it organizes the fundamental equations and underlies testable deviations from GR/SR in extreme regimes (e.g. self‑hit dominated, Planck‑core densities, early universe).
- Simulations and derivations are always performed in this preferred frame (virtual observer’s vantage point).

This places the theory as a **neo‑Lorentzian** competitor to Einstein’s spacetime ontology: empirically equivalent where tested, but conceptually rooted in a fixed substrate with explicit microphysics.
