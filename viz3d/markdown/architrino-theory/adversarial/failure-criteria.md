## The Lorentzian Conspiracy Stop-Condition

While the Absolute Observer is a powerful tool, it introduces a "Hard Wall" for the theory.

1. **The Detection Threshold**: If the absolute frame (the "Ether rest frame") is detectable by any physical experiment (e.g., Michelson-Morley) at a level higher than $\Delta c/c > 10^{-17}$, the theory fails.
2. **Requirement of Conspiracy**: We must provide a rigorous derivation showing that the **forces between architrinos in a moving assembly** contract the assembly in the direction of motion by exactly $\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$ in the absolute frame.
3. **Falsification**: If the tri-binary stability analysis shows that the assembly "breaks" or "distorts" at high absolute velocities in a way that *doesn't* match the Lorentz transformation, the Absolute Observer becomes a liability, and the theory must be discarded.
