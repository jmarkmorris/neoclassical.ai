### Risk: "Aether" Labeling

1. **Flag**: The "Sea of Coupled Noether Cores" + "Absolute Observer" structure is functionally an Aether theory.
2. **Mitigation**: Rigorously define differences from 19th-century Luminiferous Aether (discrete assembly network vs. continuous fluid; $c_f$ dynamics vs. fluid dynamics).
3. **Stop Condition**: If Lorentz suppression requires fine-tuning >5 parameters, the "Naturalness" score drops to Red.
