### Tier-1 Hard Walls (Falsification Criteria)

1. **Lorentz Invariance Leakage**: If sidereal variation in atomic clocks exceeds $10^{-17}$, the "Absolute Frame" is too visible, and the theory is falsified.
2. **The "Ether Wind" Check**: We must prove that assembly contraction (Lorentz contraction) is a dynamic necessity of the Noether Core sea, or the model is dead on arrival.
3. **Vacuum Drag**: If the interaction with the Noether Sea causes planetary orbits to decay faster than GR's gravitational wave emission limits, the model fails.
4. **GW Speed**: $|v_{GW} - c|/c$ must be $< 10^{-15}$. Gravitational waves are density ripples in the Noether Sea; their speed must match the effective light speed.
