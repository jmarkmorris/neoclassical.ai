### Deriving Proper Time ($\tau$) from Absolute Time ($t$)

1. **Clock Mechanism**: A physical clock is a tri-binary assembly whose "tick" is its internal orbital frequency.
2. **Dilation Function**: The Absolute Observer sees the assembly's internal architrino paths lengthen as it moves or enters a dense medium (gravity).
3. **Formula Target**: We must derive $d\tau = f(\rho_{vac}, v, \Phi) dt$.
4. **GR Limit**: In the weak field, this must reproduce $d\tau = dt \sqrt{1 - 2\Phi/c^2 - v^2/c^2}$. The "curvature" is in the clock's behavior, not the coordinate's geometry.
