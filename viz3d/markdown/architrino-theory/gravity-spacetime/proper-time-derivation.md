### Deriving Proper Time ($\tau$) from Absolute Time ($t$)

1. **Clock Mechanism**: A physical clock is a tri-binary assembly whose "tick" is its internal orbital frequency.
2. **Dilation Function**: The Absolute Observer sees the assembly's internal architrino paths lengthen as it moves or enters a dense medium (gravity).
3. **Formula Target**: We must derive $d\tau = f(\rho_{vac}, v, \Phi) dt$.
4. **GR Limit**: In the weak field, this must reproduce $d\tau = dt \sqrt{1 - 2\Phi/c^2 - v^2/c^2}$. The "curvature" is in the clock's behavior, not the coordinate's geometry.

### Deriving Proper Time ($\tau$) from Absolute Time ($t$)

1. **Mechanism**: A physical clock (tri-binary) "ticks" based on internal orbital frequency.
2. **Slowing Factors**:
    - **Kinematic**: High $v$ relative to the Sea stretches internal paths (hypocycloid elongation).
    - **Gravitational**: High Vacuum density increases the "refractive index," slowing internal architrino propagation.
3. **The Derivation**: We must derive $d\tau = F(\rho_{vac}, v) dt$ and show it matches the Schwarzschild prediction $d\tau = \sqrt{1 - r_s/r} dt$ in the weak field limit.

## Addenda (Cos - supplemental)

### Deriving $\tau$ from $t$

* **Mechanism:** Time dilation is the mechanical slowing of tri-binary internal oscillation due to motion through the medium (Sea of Cores).
* **The Function:** Derive $d\tau = \frac{\omega(v)}{\omega_0} dt$.
* **AO View:** The Absolute Observer sees the clock's path lengthen (hypocycloid elongation); the clock ticks less per absolute second.
* **Limits:** Must converge to $\sqrt{1 - v^2/c_{eff}^2}$.
