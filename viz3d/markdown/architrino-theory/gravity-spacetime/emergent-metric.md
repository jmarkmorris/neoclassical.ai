### Effective Metric Emergence

1. **The Mapping**: The Absolute Observer sees a flat Euclidean metric ($\delta_{ij}$). Physical Observers perceive a curved metric ($g_{\mu\nu}$).
2. **Mechanism**: The "curvature" of General Relativity is an effective description of the variable density ($\rho_{vac}$) and stress state of the Noether Core sea. 
3. **Refraction vs. Curvature**: 
   - Light (photon assembly) travels in a straight line in the Void.
   - The Noether Sea density increases near mass.
   - This density change reduces the effective propagation speed ($c_{eff} < c_f$).
   - The resulting path is "refracted," appearing as a geodesic in a curved manifold to the Physical Observer.
4. **Coordinate Identity**: $(x,y,z)$ labels are permanent. GR’s diffeomorphism invariance is an approximate symmetry valid only in the low-energy continuum limit of the assembly medium.
