### Mapping to PPN Constraints

1. **Shapiro Delay**: Must map the GR time-delay (longer path in curved space) to the Architrino time-delay (slower $c_{eff}$ in a dense medium).
2. **Light Bending**: Calculate the refraction of tri-binary signals through the Noether Sea density gradient around the Sun. Target accuracy: $10^{-5}$.
3. **Geodetic Precession**: Derived from the interaction of the assembly's angular momentum with the gradient of the Noether Sea's potential.
