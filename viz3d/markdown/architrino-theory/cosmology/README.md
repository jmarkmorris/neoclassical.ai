## Addenda (Cos)

### Cosmology in the Absolute Frame

1. **Two Times**: We analyze dynamics using **Absolute time $t$** (for the Virtual Observer/Simulation) and **Cosmic time $\tau_c$** (effective FRW time for physical observers).
2. **Expansion Ontology**: The universe is a fixed box containing a medium (Noether cores) that is evolving/relaxing. It is not a box that is getting bigger.

## Addenda (Cos - supplemental)

### Two Time Notions

* **Absolute Time ($t$):** Used by the Virtual Observer. Linear, global.
* **Cosmic Time ($\tau_c$):** Reconstructed from comoving clocks (FRW time).
* **Dynamics:** Expansion is the evolution of the network in $t$.
