### Cosmological Expansion in the Euclidean Void

1. **The Scale Factor ($a(t)$)**: Expansion is **not** the stretching of space. The Absolute Observer sees the $(x,y,z)$ coordinates remain fixed.
2. **Expansion Mechanism**: Expansion is the statistical increase in the separation of Noether cores or the "scaling up" of the Tri-Binary radius over absolute time.
3. **Redshift**: Photons (assemblies) lose internal frequency as they travel because they are coupling to a background Noether Sea that is itself scaling or changing density over time.
4. **$H_0$ Tension**: Variations in the local density of the Noether Sea (voids vs. filaments) lead to different effective scaling rates, naturally explaining $H_0$ discrepancies.
