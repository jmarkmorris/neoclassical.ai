### Cosmological Expansion in the Euclidean Void

1. **The Scale Factor ($a(t)$)**: Expansion is **not** the stretching of space. The Absolute Observer sees the $(x,y,z)$ coordinates remain fixed.
2. **Expansion Mechanism**: Expansion is the statistical increase in the separation of Noether cores or the "scaling up" of the Tri-Binary radius over absolute time.
3. **Redshift**: Photons (assemblies) lose internal frequency as they travel because they are coupling to a background Noether Sea that is itself scaling or changing density over time.
4. **$H_0$ Tension**: Variations in the local density of the Noether Sea (voids vs. filaments) lead to different effective scaling rates, naturally explaining $H_0$ discrepancies.

## Addenda (Cos)

### Expansion as Scaling, Not Stretching

1. **Fixed Background**: The Euclidean Void does **not** expand.
2. **Assembly Scaling**: "Cosmic Expansion" is the statistical growth of the radius of the **Outer Binary** of vacuum assemblies over absolute time $t$.
3. **Redshift**: Photons (tri-binaries) traveling through a scaling medium undergo frequency decay. The Absolute Observer sees the photon "growing" and "slowing."
4. **Cosmic Time**: FRW "Cosmic Time" is an approximation of absolute time $t$, reconstructed from the behavior of comoving assembly clocks.

## Addenda (Cos - supplemental)

### Expansion via Scaling

* **Fixed Void:** The Euclidean grid does *not* expand.
* **Scaling:** Cosmic expansion is the uniform growth of the Outer Binary radius of the vacuum assemblies (Noether cores) over absolute time.
* **Redshift:** Photons (assemblies) "grow" (wavelength increases) and "slow" (frequency drops) as they traverse the scaling medium.
* **H0 Tension:** Local variations in vacuum density (voids vs. clusters) affect the local scaling rate.
