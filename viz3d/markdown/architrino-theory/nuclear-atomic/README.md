### Multi-Body Assembly Structure

1. **Nucleons as Defects**: Protons and neutrons are modeled as stable excitations or "defects" within the background Noether Sea.
2. **Nuclear Force**: The "Strong Force" is the residual interaction between Tri-Binary assemblies at short range (approaching the $v = c_f$ self-hit limit).
3. **Superfluid Vacuum**: Given the Helium-like (2 pro + 2 anti) coupling of the vacuum cores, the vacuum should be analyzed as a superfluid medium. This explains inertia as motion without resistance until a critical energy threshold is reached.
4. **Atomic Resonance**: Atomic orbitals are standing-wave resonances of architrino decorations within the aether lattice.
