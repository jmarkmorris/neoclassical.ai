# Tests Directory

This directory contains test data and scripts for testing the NPQG simulator.

## Structure

- `test_data/`: Contains test simulation result files and other test data
  - `test_action_functions.json`: Test simulation results with basic action function
  - `test_spiral.json`: Test simulation results with spiral action function
  - `test_output.json`: General test output file

## Running Tests

Currently, there are no automated tests. This directory is used for storing test data generated during development and testing.

Future improvements may include:

1. Unit tests for core simulator functionality
2. Integration tests for the simulation and visualization pipeline
3. Test scripts for action functions
